Its open source, developer friendly and generally a very useful tool. <strong>Its killer feature is being able to time travel</strong>, visually; to see actions as they take place and when a test fails, but also to move about in time, to the steps before a failure, which passed.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><video poster="https://www.cypress.io/static/running-tests-a13d50eec188de01e441716a14ef88c8.jpg" playsinline autoplay loop aria-label="Running test"><source src="https://www.cypress.io/static/running-tests-a75997cdc1013fc4b1705c1be3a094c7.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://www.cypress.io/static/running-tests-8139a291d21e2b19db11f41c8c5aadf3.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Being able to see the lead up to a failure really helps in identifying root causes, especially in the context of integration tests.<strong> It even records videos and takes screen shots</strong> if you run it headlessly (via the command line).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://www.acmconsulting.eu/content/images/2021/04/spacex.land.spec.png" class="kg-image" alt="API testing in the browser?" loading="lazy" width="761" height="116" srcset="http://www.acmconsulting.eu/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/spacex.land.spec.png 600w, http://www.acmconsulting.eu/content/images/2021/04/spacex.land.spec.png 761w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>We were sold!</strong></p><h2 id="but-the-ui-can-be-slow">But, the UI can be slow</h2><p>Even something as basic as logging in, when done via the UI, is a multi step process, requiring quite a number of clicks, page loads, characters to be typed etc. The net result of all this is a request to an API login endpoint to get a bearer token.</p><p>As suggested in the <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes/blob/master/examples/logging-in__single-sign-on/cypress/integration/logging-in-single-sign-on-spec.js">cypress tutorials</a>, you can speed up slow multi-step UI processes by using <code>cy.request</code> directly, skipping all the slow UI parts. </p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const options = {
  method: &apos;POST&apos;,
  url: &apos;http://auth.corp.com:7075/login&apos;,
  qs: {
	// use qs to set query string to the url that creates
	// http://auth.corp.com:8080?redirectTo=http://localhost:7074/set_token
	redirectTo: &apos;http://localhost:7074/set_token&apos;,
  },
  form: true, // we are submitting a regular form body
  body: {
	username: &apos;jane.lane&apos;,
	password: &apos;password123&apos;,
  },
}

// allow us to override defaults with passed in overrides
_.extend(options, overrides)

cy.request(options)
</code></pre><p>This works great.</p><p><strong>It&apos;s a technique you can re-use in other areas</strong>, beyond login, as a way to speed up parts of a test which you are not actually testing. But, sometimes things fail - we are testing after all.</p><p>Using request like this is detailed well in the official documentation: <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request#Timeouts">https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request#Timeouts</a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://docs.cypress.io/_nuxt/img/testing-request-url-and-its-response-body-headers.765a174.png" class="kg-image" alt="API testing in the browser?" loading="lazy"></figure><p>However, <strong>API requests are 2nd class citizens in cypress</strong>. You will see what failed (the expect), as shown above, but if it fails, you won&apos;t know why/see the data.</p><p>To see the data, you need to open the console, as shown below - which is fine when working interactively, but when headless, you miss out on all this information.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://docs.cypress.io/_nuxt/img/console-log-request-response-body-headers-status-url.de54c8a.png" class="kg-image" alt="API testing in the browser?" loading="lazy"></figure><h2 id="enter-cypress-rest-graphql">Enter <code>cypress-rest-graphql</code>!</h2><p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-api"><code>cy-api</code></a> we built a plugin to make working with REST and GraphQL end points easier and importantly, to display the data even in headless mode!</p><p>The <code>cy-api</code> module was good, but its focus was a little different and looked for tighter <a href="https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/api-testing-with-sever-logs/">API integration / logging</a>. We wanted something simpler, which didn&apos;t assume any API level integration. So we built <code>cypress-rest-graphql</code>.</p><p><code>cypress-rest-graphql</code> focuses on providing a few key commands:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">/**

By using the same questions/metrics/structure everyone knows what to expect which lets them focus on the change, not the structure.</p><p>An example of this is the 5:15 report (<a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/management/cut-down-on-reports-with-the-5-15-method/article4106997/">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/management/cut-down-on-reports-with-the-5-15-method/article4106997/</a>). The idea of this report is to create a status update which takes no more than 15 minutes to write, and no more than 5 minutes to read/understand. Repeatable format, easy to use.</p><p>I use 5:15 reports with my directs and manager as a way to get on the same page before a 1:1, so we can spend more time talking about things that need to be discussed.</p><p>I customized the 5:15 template, to work for me/my team. This the 1:1 template i use:</p><p><strong>1. What personal accomplishments were made in the last week?</strong><br><strong>2. What are your personal priorities for the next week?</strong><br><strong>3. What blockers do you have, were overcome, do you see coming?</strong><br><strong>4. What would you like advice/guidance/help/more time to think about?</strong><br><strong>5. How are you feeling about work in general? Where is your head at?</strong><br><strong>6. What interesting/funny/clever thing caught your eye recently (can be non-work related)?</strong></p><p>I really like the last 2 questions, as they can give a great jumping off point for the 1:1 and insight into how things are going.</p><p>I&apos;ve also tried to use this format for group/team updates, but with less success. </p><p>Very interested to learn about other patterns or templates, especially for group / department or company wide levels. Please drop me a note on the usual channels if you have found things that work.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello 👻 World]]></title><description><![CDATA[8 years ago I started blogging on Tumblr - Today I moved to Ghost.]]></description><link>http://www.acmconsulting.eu/post/hello-world/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6065a283a39bd264341534b2</guid><category><![CDATA[Tools]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex McFadyen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 09:09:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://www.acmconsulting.eu/content/images/2021/04/ghost-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="bye-bye-tumblr">Bye bye Tumblr</h2><img src="http://www.acmconsulting.eu/content/images/2021/04/ghost-1.jpg" alt="Hello &#x1F47B; World"><p>I&apos;m finally off Tumblr! I&apos;ve moved to <a href="https://ghost.org/" rel="noopener"><em>Ghost</em></a><em>, </em>a NodeJS based CMS/Blogging platform. </p><p>An interesting coincidence, just as I was doing my <em><a href="http://www.acmconsulting.eu/tumblr/first-post/" rel="noopener">First Post</a></em> to Tumblr, 8 years ago, Ghost was just starting out via a<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform/description"> Kickstarter campaign</a> - now, 8 years on they released a new version <a href="https://ghost.org/changelog/4/">https://ghost.org/changelog/4/</a>.</p><h2 id="why-%F0%9F%91%BB">Why &#x1F47B;?</h2><p>The editor experience is really nice in Ghost, a what you see is what you mean style, with a very Markdown feeling editor. I liked it.</p><p>They have clearly been thinking about the publishing and editing experience, with a lot of nice features, without much bloat. </p><p>It supports scheduling, large number of integrations etc. A very polished first impression for sure.</p><p>I did consider other systems <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby.js</a>+<a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, basically anything from the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAM stack</a> trend. I was trying to avoid hosted solutions or massive PHP systems (<a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>/<a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>), no time for keeping up with patches. </p><p>Really, it came down to the editor experience in JAM style systems and Ghost won.</p><h2 id="moving">Moving</h2><p>I had 8 years of post in Tumblr, over 110 posts, which I wanted to keep. Thankfully Tumblr has a great API, and I was able to extract the old posts out using a slightly modified version of <em><a href="https://github.com/jpadilla/tumblr-to-ghost" rel="noopener">Tumblr-to-ghost</a></em>. I found the tags made things messy when re-importing to ghost, so modified the script to just assign a single tag (<a href="http://www.acmconsulting.eu/tag/tumblr/" rel="noopener"><em>Tumblr</em></a>) when importing. </p><p>I also found a few other tools, for getting data out, including a <a href="https://polymath.net/2020/12/ghost-markdown-backend/" rel="noopener"><em>great post by Pollymath.net</em></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jaanus/tumblr2markdown">Tumblr2Markdown</a> was really nice, but in the end the simple approach worked well for me.</p><h2 id="theme">Theme</h2><p>I took a stock base theme called Edition, removed the membership features (which as of Ghost 4 are forced on you, <em><a href="https://forum.ghost.org/t/ghost-4-0-really-terrible-for-personal-blog/20811/9" rel="noopener">somewhat controversially</a></em>) and added a few other minor tweaks. It&apos;s on GitHub - <em><a href="https://github.com/a-c-m/Edition" rel="noopener">https://github.com/a-c-m/Edition</a></em></p><p>I like it for now. </p><h2 id="issues">Issues</h2><p>It has not been pain free, or even easy. I very nearly gave up at a few points. Many <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/15511/yak-shaving">Yaks were shaved</a>. </p><p>Problems I ran into:</p><h3 id="1-importing-markdown-to-ghost-is-hard">1. Importing Markdown to Ghost is hard</h3><ul><li>I write a lot in Markdown, so wanted an easy way to import. Turns out there isn&apos;t a good one. Which is puzzling. </li><li>Copy/Paste into the <a href="https://github.com/bustle/mobiledoc-kit">MobileDoc</a> based editor, works fine, but importing files as posts wasn&apos;t an option.</li><li>I explored various options, even starting to write my own converted. In the end I gave up and have legacy posts as embedded HTML</li></ul><h3 id="2-routing-custom-urls-in-ghost-is-non-obvious-httpsghostorgdocsthemesrouting">2. Routing / Custom URLs in Ghost is non-obvious <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/" rel="noopener">https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/</a></h3><ul><li>Initially, I wanted to keep consistent URLs for legacy posts, but this is impossible in Ghost due to how URLs and routing works. Which is made ever more confusing due to that not being clear in the UI - <em><a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/12824" rel="noopener">https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/12824</a></em></li><li>Even once you understand routing/collections, there are more gotchas - you need a new route for the homepage to list everything.

Static hosting?</h3><ul><li>Given Ghost&apos;s history/pedigree from Gatsby, seems like a simple option for static hosting would have been a no-brainer. But it&apos;s not.</li><li>I really don&apos;t want to spend over $100 per year on hosting. Nor do I want to support/maintain a NodeJS server exposed to the internet.

It is another debate entirely, while making estimates can be a critical component of wider project management frameworks, I think its important we look at estimates on their own merits (or failures) and not taint estimation with our feeling of related (and/or dependent) processes.</p><h2 id="input-vs-outcomes">INPUT VS OUTCOMES</h2><p>I consider an estimates to be part of the input, not the output.</p><p>Accelerate Metrics have give us excellent ways to measure <a href="http://www.acmconsulting.eu/tag/software-development/">software development</a> teams performance/<a href="http://www.acmconsulting.eu/post/code-metrics/">Code Metrics</a>, backed by some impressive research. They measure outcomes and there are a bunch of tools to help make this easy. None of the accelerate metrics, measure input, the book does talk a lot about the inputs - but they don&apos;t measure them.</p><p>If you start using inputs, as a measure of outcomes, you can get into an ugly place, fast. It sets up (and rewards) all sorts of bad behaviour, like padding estimates and/or you see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson&apos;s Law</a> kick in.</p><h2 id="there-is-no-cake">THERE IS NO CAKE</h2><p>I admit, the idea of not doing an estimate is appealing.</p><p>Its less work, one less thing to do, before we get to the fun part of creating. It is easy to revert to #NoEstimate in times of stress or urgency - we don&apos;t have time, it doesn&apos;t add value, just get it done. Right?</p><p>But. From the <a href="http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill/2012/12/10/no-estimate-programming-series-intro-post/">Original Post</a> that started it all:</p><blockquote>Ask Boss to select one &#x201C;small&#x201D; thing that she felt was very important.</blockquote><p>Quite a bit to unpack here:</p><ul><li>&quot;Small&quot; is an estimate.</li><li>So now we are talking about degrees of estimation, not #NoEstimation. Right?</li><li>How does the team/pm/dev know what &quot;small&quot; is? Relative to other tasks? Relative to total time of the project?</li><li>Why pick a small thing? Why not just the very important thing?</li></ul><p>Even in #NoEstimate, we still expect estimates.</p><p>Even if you remove the word &quot;Small&quot; and used any story without some kind of understanding of size, then there is the question of what&apos;s the right size for a story? How do you know when to break a story down more or leave it alone? What becomes our unit of work?</p><p>So we do estimate, the question is more about WHAT we do with the estimates.</p><h2 id="are-you-ok">ARE YOU OK?</h2><p>If we do have estimates (and we do), what should they be used for? I would argue, as in input, they should be used to make sure the team members are OK.</p><p>By that I mean:</p><ul><li>Is the team member stuck on their current task?</li><li>Does the team/team member have too much work?</li><li>Does the team/team member have enough work to be happy/busy?</li></ul><p>It&apos;s hard to answer the above, without some metric or measure of input.</p><ul><li>Looks like Mike has been on the same task for a week - is that OK?</li><li>Task was expected to be completed quickly = No, he may need help. We also may need to re-assess similar work in the future, what did we miss?</li><li>Task was expected to take a whole = OK, keep going, don&apos;t interrupt.</li><li>5 tasks, no estimates, is that enough work for Jane for the next 2 weeks?</li><li>All tasks are small, expected to be completed quickly = Probably not, may need more - by why does she only have small tasks?</li><li>A mix of small/large = Yes, probably</li><li>All tasks are huge and complex = More than enough, perhaps we need to see about sharing out the work better?</li></ul><p>If we use estimates as a way to keep teams happy and productive (not as a measure of output/outcomes), I think we can keep a lot of the value from estimation, its when estimates are used as a tool to measure output and/or fix deadlines, that we get into trouble.</p><h2 id="how-big-is-small">HOW BIG IS SMALL?</h2><p>&quot;It depends&quot; &#x2192; &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter&quot;</p><p>But then why bother at all?</p><p>Because, I would argue, the value is in coming from an agreed group understanding on complexity/likely time to deliver. Doesn&apos;t really matter how you measure it: hours, story points or story count - it doesn&apos;t matter. The value here is in (as a team) exploring and communicating what needs to be done and how hard it might be to do it, before you start doing it.</p><p>The process of estimation is high value. Estimating work means dedicating time to understand it, agreeing on that understanding and then communicating that understanding in a standardized way.</p><p>That act of discussing, and then estimating can tease out unexpected or overlooked complexity, miss-understandings and gaps in understanding. If 3 devs agree, but one other has a very different estimate, that is something to be discussed.</p><p>Small? I&apos;ve found that once a single task gets over a few days, all bets are off, so we should break it down and/or get more context. For me, an upper bound on tickets should be a few days.</p><p>What metric you use is much less important than the act of discussing and agreeing. And, once you have that agreement, that metric can be communicated to others, who can take it into consideration when deciding on the importance of any give task or group of tasks to achieve an outcome.</p><h2 id="be-precise">BE PRECISE?</h2><p>Precise estimates and other logical fallacies.</p><p>Another key criticism of estimates is they are not accurate, and so they are not worth the time. As I discussed above, I don&apos;t think this is true. The value is in the process, as much as the output. Refining the accuracy of the estimates is useful in as much as it helps the team communicate and coordinate and better manage their own time/and input, not output.</p><p>They get even less precise if they are used as a measure of output, as they are easy to game, pad or otherwise manipulate.</p><h2 id="why-not-velocity">WHY NOT VELOCITY?</h2><p>In many #NoEstimate posts, they point to looking at velocity (tasks/stories completed) as an alternative to estimating.</p><p>Velocity is not without its drawbacks, it can be manipulated and may incentivize the wrong behaviour depending on how the metric is used.</p><p>But, even if you skip estimation and use velocity, you are still actually estimating on the front, to slice up the work into &quot;small&quot; story units to work on. But you lose resolution, A 1 line type-o fix in a field label vs adding a new database abstraction layer - both could be a single story, but with very different estimates and are not equal.</p><p>It feels like trying to measure an input, with an outcome. And you are going to miss out on the other benefits of estimation, if you skip the process. But perhaps its fine - I&apos;m not sure.</p><h2 id="do-you-trust-me">DO YOU TRUST ME?</h2><p>The final key criticism of estimates I want to consider, is fear. Fear that the estimate they create, will be used as a tool to punish or pressure them to do things that are unsustainable, unreasonable or unachievable and which then cause undue stress and disappointment.</p><p>Yes. This can (and does) happen. It shouldn&apos;t, but it does. Will abandoning estimations fix this? I don&apos;t think so. It might move the conversation from quantitative, to qualitative - which may buy time or give the louder voices a chance to control the narrative a bit. But, if the manager/business/client etc already doesn&apos;t trust a team, a number (or lack of one) isn&apos;t going to change that.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Code Metrics]]></title><description><![CDATA[Q: "How can we measure a software development teams performance?"

<p>Bill made this statement in the context of solving the climate crisis, which makes a lot of sense, but it also (for me) applies in my professional work. Like Bill, I&#x2019;m a technophile, always looking for a solution with a technological solve, but while tech is the key, its not enough on its own.
