But it&apos;s not just quantity&#x2014;<strong>the tools unlock workflows you didn&apos;t anticipate.</strong></p><p>The git stats tool wasn&apos;t just about measurement. <strong>It changed the conversations</strong> we had about AI adoption. Having weekly data visible shifted discussions from &quot;are we using AI?&quot; to &quot;why did velocity spike here?&quot; and &quot;what patterns correlate with impact?&quot;</p><blockquote>Data visualization that was &quot;too expensive&quot; becomes standard. Custom dashboards appear for team-specific needs. The tool&apos;s existence creates new opportunities.</blockquote><h2 id="the-team-structure-question">The team structure question</h2><p>Not everyone needs to shift their mindset to tool-making. <strong>But someone should be asking the question.</strong></p><p>Here&apos;s what I&apos;m seeing: <strong>managers are doing software development again.</strong> AI coding agents lowered the barrier enough that engineering managers&#x2014;who often haven&apos;t written production code in years&#x2014;are building tools for their teams.</p><p>They&apos;re actually the perfect candidates for this. <strong>They have the broader scope.</strong> They see workflow friction across multiple developers. They understand team-wide pain points. When they invest 30 minutes building a tool, it often applies to 5-10 people, not just themselves.</p><p>The multiplication effect here is substantial. A manager who understands <strong>both the team&apos;s needs and has the technical ability</strong> to quickly prototype solutions can have outsized impact. They&apos;re not necessarily writing production features, but they&apos;re building the tooling that makes their team more effective.</p><p>Someone asks: <strong>&quot;Can I make solving this problem easier now and in the future?&quot;</strong> instead of just &quot;How do I solve this problem now?&quot;</p><p><strong>The multiplication effect compounds.</strong> A 30-minute investment in <a href="https://github.com/a-c-m/biome-suppressed">biome-suppressed</a> unblocked weeks of potential linting migration work across multiple projects. A 5-minute git stats script influenced quarterly planning discussions.

Complete adoption failure at worst.</p><p><strong>The uncomfortable truth</strong>: Telling developers to use an AI tool because it&apos;s trendy works about as well as telling them to switch to a new IDE because Gartner said so. (Spoiler: it doesn&apos;t.)</p><p>FOMO for using AI specifically for software development is extremely prevalent. Everyone&apos;s talking about it. Lots of companies are blaming their reduction in force (aka firing dev teams) on advances being made from AI.

When you find the right tool-developer-task combination, the results are staggering. I&apos;ve seen developers go from committing hundreds of lines per week to <strong>tens of thousands</strong>.

Doesn&apos;t have to be the CEO or CTO, but someone trusted should have actually used the tool on real code for real problems. Not watched a YouTube demo. Not read the marketing copy. Actually used it, for real work. For at least a week.</p><h2 id="the-framework-ive-found-to-work">The framework I&apos;ve found to work</h2><p>Forget the big bang adoption.

Tweak it if need be, then run with it.</p><h3 id="step-2-measure-what-matters">Step 2: Measure what matters</h3><p><strong>Usage metrics that have worked for me, when looking for adoption of AI tools:</strong></p><ul><li>Token/credit consumption (for usage-based tools)&#x2014;if they&apos;re not using credits, they&apos;re not using the tool</li><li>Lines of code committed (yes, it&apos;s a terrible metric, but the delta can be telling)</li><li>Actual outcomes&#x2014;faster feature delivery, fewer bugs, happier customers</li></ul><p>Satya Nadella said about <a href="https://officechai.com/ai/ai-benchmarks-are-meaningless-agi-should-lead-to-10-gdp-growth-in-developed-world-satya-nadella/">AI needing to deliver real economic impact</a>: </p><blockquote>When we say: &apos;Oh, this is like the industrial revolution,&apos; let&apos;s have that industrial revolution type of growth.

I think it&apos;s making documentation more critical than ever. Every AI interaction is like onboarding a new developer who knows nothing about your codebase. The better your docs, the better your AI performs.

Documentation has become the most high-leverage activity in your development workflow, and here&apos;s why: every time you prompt an AI agent, you&apos;re essentially onboarding a new junior developer who has <strong>zero context</strong> about your codebase, your architectural decisions, or your team&apos;s conventions.</p><p>Think about it. You pay for every token the AI processes. You wait for every context window to be filled. And most critically, the AI starts from scratch every single time. That brilliant refactoring it helped you with yesterday? Gone. The deep understanding of your module boundaries? Vanished. The nuanced grasp of why you chose that particular design pattern? Non-existent.<br><br>It&apos;s also better for the environment. AI inference is not cheap, if you can reduce the overhead of every request you make, its not only good for your token budget, its good for the planet! (I&apos;m not kidding).</p><p>This is where the paradigm shift happens. <strong>Good documentation is no longer just helpful, it&apos;s the primary interface between your team&apos;s knowledge and your AI tools.</strong></p><h2 id="your-documentation-is-now-code%E2%80%94treat-it-that-way">Your documentation is now code&#x2014;treat it that way</h2><p>Modern AI-assisted development relies on specific documentation patterns that directly impact AI performance. The emergence of files like <strong><code>.cursorrules</code></strong> and <strong><code>claude.md</code></strong> isn&apos;t just another config file trend&#x2014;these are the instruction manuals that transform a generic AI into your team&apos;s specialized assistant.</p><p>Here&apos;s what actually works:</p><p><strong>Context files are your new superpower.</strong> A well-crafted <code>claude.md</code> file in your project root should contain:</p><ul><li>Your project&apos;s architecture decisions and the <strong>why</strong> behind them</li><li>Code style preferences that go beyond what a linter can catch</li><li>Common patterns and anti-patterns specific to your codebase</li><li>Module boundaries and interaction rules</li><li>Performance considerations and optimization strategies</li><li>It is not your <code>README.md</code> focus on what the AI needs, and keep what the humans need in the <code>README.md</code>, minimize overlap.</li></ul><p><strong>Modular documentation beats monolithic files.</strong> Instead of one massive documentation file, you could structure your AI context like your code:</p><pre><code>CLAUDE.md               # Project wide context

.claude/
&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; commands/
    &#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; pr.md           # How to create a PR
    &#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; issue.md        # Pushing a new issue
    &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; review.md       # How you check/review code

src/
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; api/
&#x2502;   &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; claude.md       # API-specific context
&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; database/
    &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; claude.md       # Database context</code></pre><p><strong>Every &quot;why&quot; you document saves hundreds of future tokens or failed prompts.</strong> The AI can read your code and understand <strong>what</strong> it does. It cannot understand <strong>why</strong> you chose a particular approach, <strong>who</strong> the stakeholders are, or <strong>when</strong> certain patterns should be applied. This context is what separates useful AI suggestions from generic boilerplate.</p><p>How is also worth documenting, but <strong>not how the code works, HOW to get work done</strong>. That is the commands folder, descriptions on how your team/project does things and how the AI can use to use the tools your team depends on (more on this in the next section).</p><p>But also remember, document where your approach deviates from best practice/common wisdom, as tokens cost money/time/energy. So <strong>things which &quot;go without saying&quot; do not need to be said</strong>.</p><h2 id="mcp-changes-everything-about-tool-integration">MCP changes everything about tool integration</h2><p>Model Context Protocol (MCP) is huge. I think it should fundamentally change how you think about AI agents interacting with your development environment. </p><p>Before MCP, connecting an AI to your tools meant:</p><ul><li>Custom integrations for each AI provider</li><li>Brittle API wrappers or custom scripts</li><li>Limited access to real development workflows</li><li>Or lots of copy paste from one tool into the AI&apos;s chat</li></ul><p>With MCP, your AI can now:</p><ul><li><strong>Create tickets directly in your issue tracker</strong></li><li><strong>Get the latest documentation and best practice (<a href="https://context7.com/">Context7</a> rocks)</strong></li><li><strong>Run your CI/CD pipelines locally and interpret results (or get the results from your remote system)</strong></li><li><strong>Query your production metrics while debugging</strong></li><li><strong>Take screenshots of the local (in progress) UI to compare with a design or expected behavior</strong></li></ul><p>The protocol defines three core primitives that matter for developers:</p><ul><li><strong>Tools</strong>: Functions your AI can execute (like &quot;create_github_issue&quot; or &quot;run_test_suite&quot;)</li><li><strong>Resources</strong>: Data streams it can access (like &quot;current_sprint_tickets&quot; or &quot;error_logs&quot;)</li><li><strong>Prompts/Commands</strong>: Reusable templates for common or team specific operations</li></ul><p>This means your documentation isn&apos;t just telling the AI about your system; it&apos;s giving it the ability to actually interact with and modify your system. The implications are profound: your documentation quality now directly impacts what your AI can do, not just what it knows.</p><h2 id="the-multiplication-effect-documentation-roi-in-the-ai-era">The multiplication effect: documentation ROI in the AI era</h2><p>Here&apos;s the brutal maths. Let&apos;s say you have a team of 10 developers. Pre-AI, you might onboard 1-3 new developers per year (or more if you are growing fast). With AI, you&apos;re effectively onboarding a new &quot;developer&quot; <strong>every single time someone opens their AI coding assistant</strong>.</p><p>If each developer uses AI assistance 20 times per day, that&apos;s 200 &quot;onboardings&quot; daily. 1,000 per week. 50,000 per year.</p><p>Now multiply that by the cost difference between a well-documented onboarding (AI immediately understands your patterns and conventions) versus a poor one (AI suggests generic solutions that don&apos;t fit your architecture). The leverage is staggering.</p><p><strong>Bad documentation used to slow down new hires. Now it slows down every single AI-assisted action across your entire team.</strong></p><p>But here&apos;s the thing most teams miss: writing documentation for AI is fundamentally different from writing for humans. Humans can infer context, ask clarifying questions, and learn incrementally. AI needs everything spelled out explicitly, every single time.</p><h2 id="what-actually-works-practical-documentation-strategies-for-ai">What actually works: practical documentation strategies for AI</h2><p>After watching teams struggle and succeed with AI-assisted development, clear patterns emerge:</p><p><strong>1. Document the &quot;why,&quot; not the &quot;what&quot;</strong><br>Your AI can read <code>UserService.validateEmail()</code> and understand it validates emails. What it can&apos;t understand is why you&apos;re using a custom validator instead of a library, why email validation happens at this layer instead of the frontend, or why you allow plus-addressing but not subdomain addressing.</p><p><strong> 2. Make your context explicit and specific </strong><br>As well as the slightly redundant &quot;follow best practices,&quot; write how your &quot;house rules&quot; differ.</p><pre><code class="language-markdown">- All API endpoints must return within 200ms
- Database queries must use the read replica for GET requests
- Never store PII in logs, even at debug level
- Use dependency injection for all services except logging
</code></pre><p><strong>3. (optional) Provide examples of good and bad patterns</strong><br>If you see it making the same mistakes a lot, remind it what good looks like.</p><pre><code class="language-markdown"># Good: Explicit error handling with context
try {
  const user = await userService.find(id);
  if (!user) throw new NotFoundError(`User ${id} not found`);
} catch (error) {
  logger.error(&apos;User lookup failed&apos;, { userId: id, error });
  throw error;
}

# Bad: Swallowing errors
const user = await userService.find(id).catch(() =&gt; null);
</code></pre><p><strong>4. Version your AI context like code</strong><br>Your <code>claude.md</code> and <code>.cursorrules</code> files should be in version control, reviewed in PRs, and updated when your architecture changes. It needs to be reviewed by your very best team members, as a bad change can be repeated 100&apos;s of times a day.</p><p><strong> 5. Have the AI help you keep things fresh</strong><br>Stale AI context can be worse than no context; it actively misleads your assistant into suggesting outdated patterns. If you find yourself correcting a mistake, ask the AI what it learned from the interaction and if it should/could update the rule/context to avoid similar pitfalls in the future.</p><p><strong><em>BONUS</em></strong>: Here is a Claude command you can use to help keep its context fresh: <a href="https://gist.github.com/a-c-m/f4cead5ca125d2eaad073dfd71efbcfc">reflection.md</a><br><br>Happy prompting.

Typing not keeping up with your thoughts, or that frustrating feeling when you want someone to just get to the point, <strong>wishing you could x1.5</strong> (or even x1.75/x2 a person&apos;s real time speaking speed, like you do a podcast/audiobook).</p><p>I find it interesting,<strong> the slowest output</strong> (typing) is <strong>paired with the fastest input</strong> (reading).

So now <strong>you are stuck listening for a few minutes</strong> to what could have been a simple text message that would take only seconds to read. It&apos;s not just inconvenient&#x2014;<strong>it&apos;s inefficient</strong>. And what if there was key information in the note like a phone number, now you have to listen to the whole thing again to transcribe the details yourself. Ugh!</p><p>Look, I get it. It&apos;s sometimes <strong>it&apos;s just way easier</strong> to ramble into your (micro)phone while you&apos;re multitasking or when you&apos;ve got a complex idea that you are thinking about or that would just be<strong> a pain to type out</strong>. It also lets you throw in all those <strong>vocal cues</strong> that text just can&apos;t capture in text, which can sometimes be a critical part of the message... <u><strong>but</strong></u>.</p><p>So by switching to a voice note, on an otherwise text based communication (e.g. Slack or WhatsApp), <strong>you are forcing the recipient to spend 110% - 170% more time to process your message vs a text message</strong>, and to compound things - &#xA0;you only took about 40% of the time to make that voice note, vs typing it!</p><blockquote>Arrogant. adjective. Having or revealing an exaggerated sense of one&apos;s own importance or abilities.</blockquote><p>So that sucks.</p><h2 id="voice-to-text-as-a-solution">Voice to Text as a solution</h2><p><strong>Voice to Text </strong>it&apos;s excellent now, and <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/best-speech-to-text-apps-and-tools">built into most OSs</a> for free. Voice to Text, enables you to have the highest output throughput (@ 110+ WPM), and the receiver gets highest input by reading it (238 WPM). <strong>Win-Win.</strong></p><p>So next time you have a long message to communicate (or even just a large amount of text to write), try Voice to Text. It lets you <strong>get the idea down fast</strong>, but gives you the chance to <strong>then edit that idea</strong>, to make it easy to consume. (It can be quite humbling the first time you do it).</p><p>You could even <strong>dictate to a LLM</strong> and get<strong> the AI to clean up your ramblings</strong> into a coherent form, saving you time and still allowing the receiver to skim it/copy and paste/quote reply/use their own LLM to reply etc.</p><p>I&apos;ve been trying to use Voice to Text more in my day to day (part of this blog post was written this way), and<strong> it does help.</strong> Give it a try! </p><h2 id="but-what-about-automatic-transcripts">But what about automatic transcripts?</h2><p>Some tools do this, run voice to text for you, automatically and then show the <strong>transcript alongside the audio</strong>. </p><p>But, it&apos;s <strong>not much better than x2&apos;ing the playback speed</strong> (if your brain can cope with that). You might be able to <strong>jam more words into your brain per minute </strong>by increasing the playback speed; but the quality of the output tends to still be quite low, filler words, lack of formatting, <strong>lack of structure</strong>, meandering thoughts etc all make the result <strong>less valuable</strong> than a crafted text based message. </p><h2 id="lets-communicate-better-faster-more-effectively">Let&apos;s communicate better, faster, more effectively</h2><p>So, the next time you&apos;re tempted to send a voice note, or have a large amount of text to communicate; remember you have the options of <strong>Voice to Text</strong> and the power of a well crafted message. It&#x2019;s a small shift that can have a <strong>big impact on productivity</strong> and respect for each other&apos;s time.</p><p><strong>Give it a try! </strong>Your recipients (and future self) will thank you. After all, a little extra thought and time now can lead to a lot more clarity later!</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nest.JS 🦁 - Getting started video playlist]]></title><description><![CDATA[Taming the Nest.JS lion 🦁 with a hand-picked YouTube playlist.

A moment in the book had me put it down, to write down what was said.</p><p>In the Expanse, there is a<strong> brilliant woman</strong> called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/characters/nm0013037?ref_=tt_cl_c_4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrisjen </a><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/characters/nm0013037?ref_=tt_cl_c_4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avasarala</a> </strong>(who is also played by an amazing actress, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohreh_Aghdashloo" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shohreh Agadashloo</a>, in the TV show). She&apos;s strong, smart, powerful and all round awesome in the book/show, and last night I got to a part in the 2nd book where <strong>she said</strong> something which <strong>made me pause</strong> the audio and write it down. She said:</p><blockquote><strong>&quot;A failure you understand is a victory&quot;</strong></blockquote><p>This <strong>really</strong> resonated with me. I&apos;ve seen this idea before, but it&apos;s nice to have a pithy one-liner to focus the mind.</p><p>At work, we talk and think a lot about &quot;<strong>Bets</strong>&quot;, a concept we took from <strong>Marty Cagan</strong>&apos;s product management philosophy (see <a href="https://amzn.to/41ZOx7S">Inspired</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/41ZOx7S">Empowered</a> books). In the books, Marty talks a lot about <strong>focusing on outcomes</strong> (<em>not output)</em> and on this idea of framing work as a Bet, not a task. A bet is a gamble, an investment of time to achieve an outcome. Importantly, <strong>bets can fail</strong>, and then you don&apos;t get your outcome - BUT, <strong>if your bet&apos;s never fail, then they are probably just tasks</strong>.</p><p>One of the <strong>bigger challenges</strong> for people new to this way of working and the idea of a Bet, is that they can (and SHOULD) fail now and then. Too many engineers <strong>equate Bet with an Epic or task</strong>, which needs to be a success - or they feel like they did something wrong if they fail.</p><p>There are<strong> two big problems with never failing</strong> (a bet in this context, but applies more generally):</p><ol><li><strong>Low risk = Low reward.</strong> Risk = Reward is an old adage, but holds up. So if you want big rewards there probably needs to be a chance of failure, and if a team or person never fails, they are probably not taking enough risks.</li><li><strong>Low signal = Low action.</strong> &#xA0;If it&apos;s only just a success, or it&apos;s unclear why it was a success - how can you use that data to improve next time? The more understanding, the clearer the signal, the more actionable the next step/change will be.</li></ol><p>I don&apos;t want to fail, or my teammates to fail, but<strong> I want to learn, more than I want to not fail</strong>. Sometimes you have to fail to learn. &#xA0;<br><br>So next time you fail, <strong>don&apos;t be disheartened by a failure</strong>, but only if you can understand WHY it failed - as then<strong> it&apos;s not a failure at al</strong>l, but the basis of your next, more educated and informed attempt!</p><p>Edison himself was a famous proponent of this idea:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Thomas Edison - Wikiquote</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description"></div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://en.wikiquote.org/static/favicon/wikiquote.ico" alt="Victory from failure?"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Contributors to Wikimedia projects</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Edison-at_home_in_Ft._Myers_Florida_1914_detail_LC-LC-USZ62-131044%2C_adjusted.jpg" alt="Victory from failure?"></div></a></figure><blockquote><strong>I would construct a theory and work on its lines until I found it was untenable. </strong>Then it would be discarded at once and <strong>another theory evolved</strong>.

Lots of fascinating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23488017/openai-chatbot-chatgpt-ai-examples-web-demo">experiments</a>, making it <a href="https://thetinycto.com/blog/writing-a-game-using-chatgpt">write code</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/Gaelan/cf5ae4a1e9d8d64cb0b732cf3a38e04a">pass exams</a>/<a href="https://github.com/golergka/advent-of-code-2022-with-chat-gpt/blob/master/day_1/README.md">challenges</a> or <a href="https://80.lv/articles/movie-script-outline-generated-with-chatgpt/">write scripts</a>. <strong>It&apos;s extremely impressive.</strong></p><p>I made <a href="https://www.acmconsulting.eu/post/would-you-hire-gpt-3-to-be-a-dev/">a post</a> back in July about GPT-3 being able to pass basic technical interview questions. It seems like <strong>ChatGPT has turned this up to 11</strong>.</p><p>But. (its a big but). The important thing to remember, is what while <strong>ChatGPT may generate very real looking text</strong>, answers and code, the things it&apos;s saying are <strong>made up</strong> (which is what it was made to do). And, <strong>some of the things it makes up are wrong.</strong></p><p><strong>The challenge </strong>here, is the things it&apos;s generating can be technically and semantically correct, and sound <strong>extremely plausible</strong> - they can have huge factual or implementation errors which are <strong>very hard to spot unless you already know the correct answer</strong>.</p><p>As an example, <strong>try asking what it knows about your home town, or about a team/historical event you know well.</strong> It feels like some kind of <strong>uncanny valley</strong>, but only if you know the domain/truth.</p><p>I for example asked <strong>&quot;What do you know about Beaconsfield&quot;</strong>, which is a town outside London, where I have spent a lot of time. </p><p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong></p><blockquote>&quot;Beaconsfield is a town in the county of Buckinghamshire, England. It is located about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of London. The town is named after the beacon field that was once located there, and it is known for its historic buildings and picturesque setting. Beaconsfield Old Town, which is the historic center of the town, is a particularly popular attraction, with its cobbled streets and well-preserved Georgian and Victorian buildings. The town is also home to several notable residents, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, who has a home in the area&quot;</blockquote><p><strong>Breaking the response down</strong>: <br>&#x2705; &#xA0;&quot;Beaconsfield is a town in the county of Buckinghamshire, England&quot;<br>&#x2705; &quot;It is located about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of London.&quot;<br>&#x274C; &quot;The town is named after the beacon field that was once located there&quot;<br>&#x274C; &quot;with its cobbled streets&quot;<br>&#x274C; &quot;Boris Johnson, who has a home in the area&quot;</p><p>Without knowing the area (or looking it up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaconsfield">Wikipedia</a>/<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@51.6012888,-0.636418,3a,75y,328.86h,95.05t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sI18NNZxeOOZ-d48d1tto9g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192">google street view</a>) <strong>you would very easily believe the false claims the AI is making</strong>. Everything it said seemed reasonable, it was only the &quot;cobbled streets&quot; that caught my eye and made me investigate the other claims.</p><p>Which is scary, as <strong>the lies seems so plausible. </strong>I lived there for years and had to check, as<strong> I didn&apos;t trust my own memory. </strong>Yet the AI was able to stitch together something which<strong> feels real</strong>, feels based on concepts and ideas which could be right, Beaconsfield is exactly the sort of place that would have cobbled streets, where Boris Johnson might have a home - &#xA0;but<strong> it&apos;s just not true</strong>.</p><p>I tried it with a few other towns too, very similar results, core facts right but <strong>believable half-truths or embellishments</strong> around the side. Like an author <strong>writing about a place but without ever going there</strong> (or having the internet to check against).</p><p><strong>It is a hugely impressive tool</strong>, which is going to take a while for us to appreciate and learn how to leverage, but I caution you not to trust anything it tells you, as it seems to have a habit of <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/spin+a+yarn">spinning a convincing yarn</a>. <br><br>(<strong>no part of this post</strong> except where quoted <strong>was written by an AI</strong> - but then again, that&apos;s what an AI would say). <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">Happy playing</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Your most important team is...?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Which team would you say is your most important?
