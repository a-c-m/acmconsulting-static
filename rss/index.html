A moment in the book had me put it down, to write down what was said.</p><p>In the Expanse, there is a<strong> brilliant woman</strong> called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/characters/nm0013037?ref_=tt_cl_c_4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrisjen </a><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/characters/nm0013037?ref_=tt_cl_c_4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avasarala</a> </strong>(who is also played by an amazing actress, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohreh_Aghdashloo" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shohreh Agadashloo</a>, in the TV show). She&apos;s strong, smart, powerful and all round awesome in the book/show, and last night I got to a part in the 2nd book where <strong>she said</strong> something which <strong>made me pause</strong> the audio and write it down. She said:</p><blockquote><strong>&quot;A failure you understand is a victory&quot;</strong></blockquote><p>This <strong>really</strong> resonated with me. I&apos;ve seen this idea before, but it&apos;s nice to have a pithy one-liner to focus the mind.</p><p>At work, we talk and think a lot about &quot;<strong>Bets</strong>&quot;, a concept we took from <strong>Marty Cagan</strong>&apos;s product management philosophy (see <a href="https://amzn.to/41ZOx7S">Inspired</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/41ZOx7S">Empowered</a> books). In the books, Marty talks a lot about <strong>focusing on outcomes</strong> (<em>not output)</em> and on this idea of framing work as a Bet, not a task. A bet is a gamble, an investment of time to achieve an outcome. Importantly, <strong>bets can fail</strong>, and then you don&apos;t get your outcome - BUT, <strong>if your bet&apos;s never fail, then they are probably just tasks</strong>.</p><p>One of the <strong>bigger challenges</strong> for people new to this way of working and the idea of a Bet, is that they can (and SHOULD) fail now and then. Too many engineers <strong>equate Bet with an Epic or task</strong>, which needs to be a success - or they feel like they did something wrong if they fail.</p><p>There are<strong> two big problems with never failing</strong> (a bet in this context, but applies more generally):</p><ol><li><strong>Low risk = Low reward.</strong> Risk = Reward is an old adage, but holds up. So if you want big rewards there probably needs to be a chance of failure, and if a team or person never fails, they are probably not taking enough risks.</li><li><strong>Low signal = Low action.</strong> &#xA0;If it&apos;s only just a success, or it&apos;s unclear why it was a success - how can you use that data to improve next time? The more understanding, the clearer the signal, the more actionable the next step/change will be.</li></ol><p>I don&apos;t want to fail, or my teammates to fail, but<strong> I want to learn, more than I want to not fail</strong>. Sometimes you have to fail to learn. &#xA0;<br><br>So next time you fail, <strong>don&apos;t be disheartened by a failure</strong>, but only if you can understand WHY it failed - as then<strong> it&apos;s not a failure at al</strong>l, but the basis of your next, more educated and informed attempt!</p><p>Edison himself was a famous proponent of this idea:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Thomas Edison - Wikiquote</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description"></div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://en.wikiquote.org/static/favicon/wikiquote.ico" alt="Victory from failure?"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Contributors to Wikimedia projects</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Edison-at_home_in_Ft._Myers_Florida_1914_detail_LC-LC-USZ62-131044%2C_adjusted.jpg" alt="Victory from failure?"></div></a></figure><blockquote><strong>I would construct a theory and work on its lines until I found it was untenable. </strong>Then it would be discarded at once and <strong>another theory evolved</strong>.

Lots of fascinating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23488017/openai-chatbot-chatgpt-ai-examples-web-demo">experiments</a>, making it <a href="https://thetinycto.com/blog/writing-a-game-using-chatgpt">write code</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/Gaelan/cf5ae4a1e9d8d64cb0b732cf3a38e04a">pass exams</a>/<a href="https://github.com/golergka/advent-of-code-2022-with-chat-gpt/blob/master/day_1/README.md">challenges</a> or <a href="https://80.lv/articles/movie-script-outline-generated-with-chatgpt/">write scripts</a>. <strong>It&apos;s extremely impressive.</strong></p><p>I made <a href="https://www.acmconsulting.eu/post/would-you-hire-gpt-3-to-be-a-dev/">a post</a> back in July about GPT-3 being able to pass basic technical interview questions. It seems like <strong>ChatGPT has turned this up to 11</strong>.</p><p>But. (its a big but). The important thing to remember, is what while <strong>ChatGPT may generate very real looking text</strong>, answers and code, the things it&apos;s saying are <strong>made up</strong> (which is what it was made to do). And, <strong>some of the things it makes up are wrong.</strong></p><p><strong>The challenge </strong>here, is the things it&apos;s generating can be technically and semantically correct, and sound <strong>extremely plausible</strong> - they can have huge factual or implementation errors which are <strong>very hard to spot unless you already know the correct answer</strong>.</p><p>As an example, <strong>try asking what it knows about your home town, or about a team/historical event you know well.</strong> It feels like some kind of <strong>uncanny valley</strong>, but only if you know the domain/truth.</p><p>I for example asked <strong>&quot;What do you know about Beaconsfield&quot;</strong>, which is a town outside London, where I have spent a lot of time. </p><p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong></p><blockquote>&quot;Beaconsfield is a town in the county of Buckinghamshire, England. It is located about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of London. The town is named after the beacon field that was once located there, and it is known for its historic buildings and picturesque setting. Beaconsfield Old Town, which is the historic center of the town, is a particularly popular attraction, with its cobbled streets and well-preserved Georgian and Victorian buildings. The town is also home to several notable residents, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, who has a home in the area&quot;</blockquote><p><strong>Breaking the response down</strong>: <br>&#x2705; &#xA0;&quot;Beaconsfield is a town in the county of Buckinghamshire, England&quot;<br>&#x2705; &quot;It is located about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of London.&quot;<br>&#x274C; &quot;The town is named after the beacon field that was once located there&quot;<br>&#x274C; &quot;with its cobbled streets&quot;<br>&#x274C; &quot;Boris Johnson, who has a home in the area&quot;</p><p>Without knowing the area (or looking it up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaconsfield">Wikipedia</a>/<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@51.6012888,-0.636418,3a,75y,328.86h,95.05t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sI18NNZxeOOZ-d48d1tto9g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192">google street view</a>) <strong>you would very easily believe the false claims the AI is making</strong>. Everything it said seemed reasonable, it was only the &quot;cobbled streets&quot; that caught my eye and made me investigate the other claims.</p><p>Which is scary, as <strong>the lies seems so plausible. </strong>I lived there for years and had to check, as<strong> I didn&apos;t trust my own memory. </strong>Yet the AI was able to stitch together something which<strong> feels real</strong>, feels based on concepts and ideas which could be right, Beaconsfield is exactly the sort of place that would have cobbled streets, where Boris Johnson might have a home - &#xA0;but<strong> it&apos;s just not true</strong>.</p><p>I tried it with a few other towns too, very similar results, core facts right but <strong>believable half-truths or embellishments</strong> around the side. Like an author <strong>writing about a place but without ever going there</strong> (or having the internet to check against).</p><p><strong>It is a hugely impressive tool</strong>, which is going to take a while for us to appreciate and learn how to leverage, but I caution you not to trust anything it tells you, as it seems to have a habit of <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/spin+a+yarn">spinning a convincing yarn</a>. <br><br>(<strong>no part of this post</strong> except where quoted <strong>was written by an AI</strong> - but then again, that&apos;s what an AI would say). <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">Happy playing</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Your most important team is...?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Which team would you say is your most important?

Should we really be rotating team members around between teams? <a href="https://amzn.to/3QQcE2S">Team Topologies</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3QQcE2S">Empowered</a> both seemed to say a similar thing: <strong>create a stable team</strong> of autonomous, empowered people and flow problems to them. </p><p>But, the post backed it up its claim with a reference to one of my favourite laws, Conway&apos;s law. </p><blockquote>Failure to do this will ensure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law" rel>Conway&#x2019;s law</a> trips up your best laid plans.</blockquote><p>This got me thinking, as I thought I knew the law and its implications. Conway, in my mind, had always been about structure, that <strong>the organization&apos;s structure would dictate the system&apos;s structure</strong>.<br>But I was glossing over a key word:</p><blockquote>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&apos;s <strong><em>communication</em></strong> structure. &#x2014;&#x2009;Melvin E. Conway</blockquote><p><strong>Communication</strong>. It&apos;s not the organization&apos;s structure that&apos;s most important, it&apos;s the <strong>COMMUNICATION structure</strong>. Formal/team structure is clearly critical, but <strong>the nuance is around how information flows</strong>. </p><p>Even if you have 2 or 3 database teams, if all decisions and discussion are channelled to a single PM or EM, you practically have a single team. You also have a single point of failure.</p><p>So I can now see why rotating team members can be a preventative to Conway&apos;s trip ups. To project against theses sub-structures/communication paths, disrupting or delaying your best laid plans. It also gives you<strong> fresh eyes without fresh hires</strong> and can help permeate best practice throughout the organization.</p><p>The cost, of course, is the <strong>organizational churn</strong>, re-storming/forming/norming/performing. But in small doses, that could be<strong> a cost worth paying</strong>. &#xA0; </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Would you hire GPT-3 instead of a developer?]]></title><description><![CDATA[OpenAI's ability to generate code can probably pass your early developer screening questions - should you hire it?]]></description><link>https://www.acmconsulting.eu/post/would-you-hire-gpt-3-to-be-a-dev/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62c447b8dbdd1c4edce8beca</guid><category><![CDATA[Interesting]]></category><category><![CDATA[Jobs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Managment]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex McFadyen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 08:49:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://www.acmconsulting.eu/content/images/2022/07/an-ai-doing-a-coding-exam.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.acmconsulting.eu/content/images/2022/07/an-ai-doing-a-coding-exam.jpg" alt="Would you hire GPT-3 instead of a developer?"><p><a href="https://github.com/features/copilot/">CoPilot</a>, <strong>the AI pair programmer</strong> by <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> and GitHub/Microsoft, is <a href="https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/">generally available</a>, I&apos;ve been very slow in trying it out and so far have recommended our developers <strong>DON&apos;T use it on our internal codebases</strong> due to IP and concerns (see end).</p><p>But, you can play with the same system, to <strong>test it, without giving it access</strong> to your IDE or internal codebases, just by signing up to <a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground">OpenAI&apos;s Playground</a> - where you get <strong>$18 of free credits</strong> to ask questions of this huge AI model.</p><p>So, I did.

sequelize and knex.</code></pre><p>Ok, let&apos;s dig into that:</p><blockquote>What are the pros and cons of sequelize vs knex?</blockquote><pre><code class="language-Markdown">There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends
on personal preferences and opinions. Some people may prefer
sequelize because it offers more features and is better suited
for larger projects, while others may prefer knex because it
is simpler and easier to use.</code></pre><p><strong>It&apos;s not just code,</strong> it can answer questions about git</p><blockquote>What does the following command do?<br>git diff-tree &#x2013;r {commit hash}</blockquote><pre><code class="language-Markdown">The command git diff-tree &#x2013;r {commit hash} displays the

1. Blue/Green Deployment: With this strategy, you have two identical
production environments. You deploy your updates to the environment 
that is not currently serving traffic (the &quot;green&quot; environment), and 
then once the updates are deployed and tested, you switch traffic over
to the green environment. This ensures that there is no downtime, as 
users will always be able to access the site/application.

2. Canary Deployment: This is similar to blue/green deployment, but 
instead of having two identical production environments, you have a 
production environment and a staging environment. You deploy your 
updates to the staging environment first, and then if everything looks 
good, you deploy the updates to production. This ensures that there is 
less risk, as you can test the updates in a non-production environment 
first.

3. A/B Testing: With this strategy, you deploy your updates to a small 
subset of users first, and then if everything looks good, you deploy the 
updates to all users. This helps to reduce the risk of deploying to all 
users at once, as you can test the updates with a smaller group first.

4. Rolling Deployment: This strategy involves slowly rolling out the 
updates to all users, rather than deploying all at once. This can help 
to reduce the risk of deploying to all users at once, as you can make 
sure that the updates are working as expected before deploying to all 
users.</code></pre><p><strong>It wasn&apos;t perfect</strong>, it missed parts of questions, it got confused when I used longer and more intricate problems - but over all, it would not fare badly against most entry level or even mid level candidates!</p><p>BUT.
