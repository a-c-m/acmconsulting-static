It is a fascinating topic with some true experts in the field <em>(and me)</em> on the panel:</p><ul><li>Moderator - <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timjamesbond/">Tim Bond</a>, </strong>Director of Insight, <a href="https://dma.org.uk/">Data Marketing Association (DMA)</a></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johntrembley/">John Trembley</a>, </strong>Vice President of Marketing at <a href="https://evolv.ai/">Evolv AI</a></li><li>(me) Alex McFadyen, Head of Technology, <a href="https://ben.productplacement.coma">BEN Group</a></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilberthill/">Gilbert Hill</a>,</strong> Privacy Technologist, Entrepreneur and CEO of <a href="https://www.finflo.io/">FinFlo</a> / <a href="https://tapmydata.com/">TapMyData</a></li></ul><p>Unfortunately, the panel wasn&apos;t recorded, but I still wanted to share the debate and a few notes, as others may find it useful or thought provoking.</p><h2 id="the-core-questions-raised-in-the-debate">The core questions raised in the debate</h2><blockquote><em>When it comes to personalisation, there is often a trade off with concerns of user privacy. Consumers are more likely to pass on their personal information if they are getting truly valuable returns. Can AI help resolve the personalisation and privacy paradox? What are the right approaches?</em></blockquote><p>The conversation flowed between two main areas, privacy and how AI/Tech can help - both interlinked, and expertly navigated by Tim.</p><p>After a quick intro, &#xA0;where we discussed examples in our own lives of personalisation gone well (or badly) we dove into<strong> the question of privacy</strong>:</p><ul><li>Do consumers really care about privacy?</li><li>Is personalisation possible without raising concerns over data privacy? </li><li>How can brands explain the benefits of data sharing? (For both them and the customer)</li></ul><p>Then we moved onto how <strong>can technology help</strong>:</p><ul><li>Can AI help resolve this seeming conflict between personalisation and privacy?</li><li>Is there a risk that consumers are even more concerned by the &#x2018;black boxes&#x2019;? (Processing they can&#x2019;t even see)</li><li>What are the right approaches to bring AI into a business to help? Are there any examples you can share/are aware of?</li></ul><p>We finished on some advice, answering the question:<em> What should the organisations watching today go away and do?</em></p><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><p>Instead of trying to replicate the debate, I&apos;m going to include some ideas shared (likely poorly paraphrased/misremembered - sorry). I hope, however, they are useful or at least thought provoking:</p><ul><li>John Wanamaker (1838-1922) a pioneer in marketing said - <em>&#x201C;Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don&apos;t know which half.&#x201D;</em></li><li><strong>Personalisation, can be a double edged sword </strong>- &quot;personal service&quot; or a &quot;personal recommendation&quot; can be a big positive for the consumer, but if you &quot;get personal&quot;, <strong>it can become creepy</strong> (&quot;is my phone listening to me?&quot;, &quot;how do they know this?&quot;). Especially when the ad/suggestion is outside the expected context or far too specific.</li><li>If users are given control over their data, they will be more deliberate with it - making sure it&apos;s accurate. <strong>Deal them into the process.</strong></li><li>When done well, with the consumer&apos;s needs and privacy in mind, personalisation results in<strong> better outcomes for everyone</strong>; less wasted time/attention of consumers and less wasted dollars from the brand and money to make even better content for the creators. AI can help with all three, <strong>as we saw at BEN with Philo.</strong></li><li>Low conversion rates make already expensive customer views even more expensive - <strong>optimizing for conversion often results in a better ROI</strong> than trying to maximize for views at the top of the funnel.</li><li><strong>Black boxes of decision-making already existed before technology/AI</strong>. Human based processes can often be harder to audit and check - the increased attention to the output data is allowing better systems to be built in the future.</li><li><strong>Governments and industry have roles to play</strong>, and we&apos;ve seen great steps &#xA0;forward with things like <strong>GDPR and CCPA</strong>, but we need to be thinking past what it&apos;s possible to do technologically, or even legally and to what&apos;s <strong>the right thing to do, ethically</strong>. </li><li><strong>PET (Privacy Enhancing Technology) </strong>can help a lot, by offering systems to help improve the privacy of the data though AI or cryptographic means. <strong>Differential privacy is very interesting</strong>.</li></ul><p>My closing comment to the question : <em> What should the organisations watching today go away and do?</em></p><blockquote><em>Brands should start by aiming to <strong>empower and engage with your audience</strong>, by understanding them <strong>as a group and in context</strong> - be respectful. You don&apos;t need to stalk individuals and invade privacy to get results.</em></blockquote><h2 id="further-reading-watching">Further reading / watching</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://ben.productplacement.com/case-study/philo-influencer-campaign/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">BEN&#x2019;s custom, collaborative AI improves Philo&#x2019;s CTR by 172% and conversion efficiency by 10x. - BEN</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Over the course of the campaign our proprietary neural networks improved Philo&#x2019;s CTRs by 172%.

They had 3 levels to the rule:</p><ol><li>The Iron Rule:<em> Treat those below you as you want</em></li><li>The Silver Rule: <em>Treat others as you want to be treated</em></li><li>The Golden Rule: <em>Treat others</em><strong><em> how <u>they</u> </em></strong><em>want to be treated</em></li></ol><p><em>(A more detailed Reddit thread on this is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bobiverse/comments/j2n42t/golden_and_silver_rule_musings_spoilers/">here</a>)</em></p><p>The Golden rule, as outlined above, is also referred to as <strong>the platinum rule</strong> (like in <a href="https://amzn.to/3n1f7vg">this book</a> of the same name, published in 1996), and I really like this version. <strong>It focuses on the person</strong> (or people) you are dealing with <strong>instead of yourself</strong>.

Heavy. I know. But <strong>hard things are worth doing</strong>, and uncomfortable conversations about mental health and even suicide need to happen. <strong>We have to make the conversations about mental health and suicide safe to have</strong>, so if someone needs it, they can feel they are able to have it - the alternative is <em>never</em> having the chance to have the conversation.</p><p>The presentation by Didi Hirch was given with care, compassion, and it was surprisingly uplifting. <strong>I whole heartedly encourage people to explore getting training in suicide prevention</strong>, and/or to encourage awareness and discussion in your peer and professional groups. <strong>It&apos;s important.</strong> Didi Hirch <a href="https://didihirsch.org/training/suicide-prevention-training/">offer sessions</a>, &#xA0;but I suspect there will be similar organizations locally to you - check them out.</p><p><strong>It was an extremely thought provoking presentation</strong>.

Lots of people <strong>hate the wasted time spent</strong> on this daily grind, but some <strong>cherished elements of it</strong> - it&apos;s me time, listening to pod casts, reading, etc.</p><p>This <strong>separation of work and home</strong>, of mental states is something which, I think, deserves more attention and something we&apos;ve lost when we lost our physical commute. For me at least, being able to <strong>compartmentalize those worlds</strong> has been a critical part of maintaining a health work/life balance and perspective.</p><h2 id="how-can-you-mentally-commute">How can you mentally commute?</h2><p>Or to say it another way, <em>how do you move headspace without moving physical space</em>?</p><p>I think it&apos;s actually really simple, for me, it&apos;s and comes down to 2 things.</p><ol><li><strong>Time</strong></li><li><strong>Context</strong></li></ol><p>Both are about enabling a <strong>smooth and predictable transition</strong>, to let your brain, emotions and thoughts move from one state to another.</p><h3 id="time">Time</h3><p>Most people (myself included), <strong>need time to adjust</strong>. There are some among us who have a superpower, they are able to compartmentalize and switch extremely quickly - for everyone else, there is time.</p><p>How much time you need to settle after a day can depend on you and your day, but not spending time on this transition, risks the stresses or excitement from <strong>one area bleeding into the next</strong>. Turning the transition into a habit can also help reduce the time needed, in my experience.</p><h3 id="context">Context</h3><p>You work at work, and are at home at home. But <strong>when you work at home, things get tricky</strong>. So to help with separation, build context.</p><p>I&apos;m lucky, in that I have a room I use as my home office, this means I can leave that room and &quot;<strong>leave work&quot; in that room</strong> too. But even without a room, you can tie your work context to something, a device (a work laptop), a position/chair dedicated to work or even the clothes you are wearing. <strong>Moving out of that context is a signal</strong> to you, your brain, those around you that you&apos;re not working any more.</p><p>Give yourself something to latch onto, as <strong>&quot;work mode&quot; </strong>and so an ability to deliberately switch out of it. <strong>Without it, you are always potentially &quot;at work&quot;</strong>.</p><h2 id="my-routine">My routine</h2><p>I use both time and context to keep my work and home life separated.<strong> I plan my day and schedule around these transitions</strong> has had a HUGE impact on my ability to focus at work and unwind after.</p><p>In my morning, I will take my kids to school, walking. When I get back to the house after dropping them, <strong>I enter my &quot;office&quot; and my day begins</strong> (with the bonus of a little exercise too).</p><p>At the end of my day, I schedule a <strong>15 minute &quot;decompression&quot; time</strong>, it&apos;s in my calendar, as a meeting - I don&apos;t leave work (my room) till it&apos;s done. I use this time to <strong>take stock of the day, look at tomorrow and meditate</strong>. Its worth every second.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.calm.com/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Experience Calm</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Relax with Calm, a simple mindfulness meditation app that brings clarity and peace of mind into your life</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://www.calm.com/_n/favicon.ico" alt="Mental Commuting"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">The #1 App for Meditation and Sleep</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/calm-com/image/upload/v1584113232/www-next/social/calm-meta.png" alt="Mental Commuting"></div></a></figure><p>To help me meditate I use the Calm app. I am fortune that <strong>my employer</strong> (<a href="ben.productplacement.com/">BEN Group</a>) who<strong> takes mental health seriously</strong> and offer a free calm subscription to all employees!

Remind my teams to do the same - yes. But what about others who are not in my teams, or what about situations where you <strong>just need a pause, a moment to collect yourself</strong>?</p><p>One area of stress, especially in a COVID world has been meetings, endless back to back calls. <strong>In a physical world, you have time between meetings</strong> even if it&apos;s just walking from meeting room A to B - you get time to switch context, grab a drink etc. With all meetings happening from your desk, that&apos;s no longer there. <strong>Back to back calls can mean not even getting up from the desk for hours</strong>.</p><p>Enter <em>#firstfiveminutes </em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><a href="https://www.firstfiveminutes.club/"><img src="https://www.firstfiveminutes.club/assets/images/sharescreen.png" class="kg-image" alt="Microdosing wellness?" loading="lazy"></a></figure><blockquote>The idea is simple.

Also, if there is a 10-minute gap in your calendar, someone could just schedule another meeting into that slot!</p><p>You could also try to <strong>end your meeting early</strong> - but, lets be realistic that is much harder than it seems, especially if the conversation is flowing. Fewer meetings, meeting free days/afternoons etc are all great options too - but sometimes or for some teams/people, that&apos;s just not an option.</p><p><strong>I have decided to take matters into my own hands</strong>, to give people a microdose of calm, a moment to get water, stretch or take a bathroom break - seems silly, but the response so far has been <strong>extremely positive</strong>. I wonder if it&apos;s like <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier">giving thanks to make you happier</a>, if giving wellness/mental health can make you healthier?</p><p><strong>Can&apos;t hurt to try - right?</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hate cookie banners?

This the 1:1 template i use:</p><p><strong>1. What personal accomplishments were made in the last week?</strong><br><strong>2. What are your personal priorities for the next week?</strong><br><strong>3. What blockers do you have, were overcome, do you see coming?</strong><br><strong>4. What would you like advice/guidance/help/more time to think about?</strong><br><strong>5. How are you feeling about work in general? Where is your head at?</strong><br><strong>6. What interesting/funny/clever thing caught your eye recently (can be non-work related)?</strong></p><p>I really like the last 2 questions, as they can give a great jumping off point for the 1:1 and insight into how things are going.</p><p>I&apos;ve also tried to use this format for group/team updates, but with less success. </p><p>Very interested to learn about other patterns or templates, especially for group / department or company wide levels.

I liked it.</p><p>They have clearly been thinking about the publishing and editing experience, with a lot of nice features, without much bloat. </p><p>It supports scheduling, large number of integrations etc. A very polished first impression for sure.</p><p>I did consider other systems <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby.js</a>+<a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, basically anything from the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAM stack</a> trend.

Thankfully Tumblr has a great API, and I was able to extract the old posts out using a slightly modified version of <em><a href="https://github.com/jpadilla/tumblr-to-ghost" rel="noopener">Tumblr-to-ghost</a></em>. I found the tags made things messy when re-importing to ghost, so modified the script to just assign a single tag (<a href="https://www.acmconsulting.eu/tag/tumblr/" rel="noopener"><em>Tumblr</em></a>) when importing. </p><p>I also found a few other tools, for getting data out, including a <a href="https://polymath.net/2020/12/ghost-markdown-backend/" rel="noopener"><em>great post by Pollymath.net</em></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jaanus/tumblr2markdown">Tumblr2Markdown</a> was really nice, but in the end the simple approach worked well for me.</p><h2 id="theme">Theme</h2><p>I took a stock base theme called Edition, removed the membership features (which as of Ghost 4 are forced on you, <em><a href="https://forum.ghost.org/t/ghost-4-0-really-terrible-for-personal-blog/20811/9" rel="noopener">somewhat controversially</a></em>) and added a few other minor tweaks.

But it does look like it&apos;s going on all night. The debate still rages, and who doesn&apos;t love a heated debate. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NoEstimates">https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NoEstimates</a></p><p>There are very smart people advocating for no estimates at all. There is a nice post by Malcom Isaacs, called <a href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/noestimates-debate-unbiased-look-origins-arguments-thought-leaders-behind-movement">&quot;The #NoEstimate debate&quot;</a>, which seems to hit a lot of the high notes and key players.</p><p>As I have come to understand it, the origin of this debate was trigged by a 2012 blog post titled <a href="http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill/2012/12/10/no-estimate-programming-series-intro-post/">No Estimate Programming Series</a> by <a href="http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill/">Woody Zuill</a>, where he outlined the case for #NoEstimates.</p><p>No point me rehashing the debate, it&apos;s better if you read the debate summary and origin post above. Then I can dive into my own 0.02 units of currency on the topic.</p><p>Why am I sharing? Because I want to test my hypnosis. By sharing my thoughts and take on this, I am actively seeking contrary/other/agreeing points of view, so I can be better informed and make the right choices for my self and my team.</p><h2 id="guilty-by-association">GUILTY BY ASSOCIATION</h2><p>Some criticism of estimation, to me, seem to be linked to other processes people associate with estimation.</p><p>Using estimate to set hard delivery deadlines at the start of a project is very unpopular (rightly). Estimation is being associated with that bad practice, but it&apos;s not the process of estimation at fault - its how the estimate is being used.</p><p>Waterfall vs Scrum vs Kanban vs ?? It is another debate entirely, while making estimates can be a critical component of wider project management frameworks, I think its important we look at estimates on their own merits (or failures) and not taint estimation with our feeling of related (and/or dependent) processes.</p><h2 id="input-vs-outcomes">INPUT VS OUTCOMES</h2><p>I consider an estimates to be part of the input, not the output.</p><p>Accelerate Metrics have give us excellent ways to measure <a href="https://www.acmconsulting.eu/tag/software-development/">software development</a> teams performance/<a href="https://www.acmconsulting.eu/post/code-metrics/">Code Metrics</a>, backed by some impressive research. They measure outcomes and there are a bunch of tools to help make this easy. None of the accelerate metrics, measure input, the book does talk a lot about the inputs - but they don&apos;t measure them.</p><p>If you start using inputs, as a measure of outcomes, you can get into an ugly place, fast. It sets up (and rewards) all sorts of bad behaviour, like padding estimates and/or you see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson&apos;s Law</a> kick in.</p><h2 id="there-is-no-cake">THERE IS NO CAKE</h2><p>I admit, the idea of not doing an estimate is appealing.</p><p>Its less work, one less thing to do, before we get to the fun part of creating. It is easy to revert to #NoEstimate in times of stress or urgency - we don&apos;t have time, it doesn&apos;t add value, just get it done. Right?</p><p>But. From the <a href="http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill/2012/12/10/no-estimate-programming-series-intro-post/">Original Post</a> that started it all:</p><blockquote>Ask Boss to select one &#x201C;small&#x201D; thing that she felt was very important.</blockquote><p>Quite a bit to unpack here:</p><ul><li>&quot;Small&quot; is an estimate.</li><li>So now we are talking about degrees of estimation, not #NoEstimation. Right?</li><li>How does the team/pm/dev know what &quot;small&quot; is? Relative to other tasks? Relative to total time of the project?</li><li>Why pick a small thing? Why not just the very important thing?</li></ul><p>Even in #NoEstimate, we still expect estimates.</p><p>Even if you remove the word &quot;Small&quot; and used any story without some kind of understanding of size, then there is the question of what&apos;s the right size for a story? How do you know when to break a story down more or leave it alone? What becomes our unit of work?</p><p>So we do estimate, the question is more about WHAT we do with the estimates.</p><h2 id="are-you-ok">ARE YOU OK?</h2><p>If we do have estimates (and we do), what should they be used for? I would argue, as in input, they should be used to make sure the team members are OK.</p><p>By that I mean:</p><ul><li>Is the team member stuck on their current task?</li><li>Does the team/team member have too much work?</li><li>Does the team/team member have enough work to be happy/busy?</li></ul><p>It&apos;s hard to answer the above, without some metric or measure of input.</p><ul><li>Looks like Mike has been on the same task for a week - is that OK?</li><li>Task was expected to be completed quickly = No, he may need help. We also may need to re-assess similar work in the future, what did we miss?</li><li>Task was expected to take a whole = OK, keep going, don&apos;t interrupt.</li><li>5 tasks, no estimates, is that enough work for Jane for the next 2 weeks?</li><li>All tasks are small, expected to be completed quickly = Probably not, may need more - by why does she only have small tasks?</li><li>A mix of small/large = Yes, probably</li><li>All tasks are huge and complex = More than enough, perhaps we need to see about sharing out the work better?</li></ul><p>If we use estimates as a way to keep teams happy and productive (not as a measure of output/outcomes), I think we can keep a lot of the value from estimation, its when estimates are used as a tool to measure output and/or fix deadlines, that we get into trouble.</p><h2 id="how-big-is-small">HOW BIG IS SMALL?</h2><p>&quot;It depends&quot; &#x2192; &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter&quot;</p><p>But then why bother at all?</p><p>Because, I would argue, the value is in coming from an agreed group understanding on complexity/likely time to deliver. Doesn&apos;t really matter how you measure it: hours, story points or story count - it doesn&apos;t matter. The value here is in (as a team) exploring and communicating what needs to be done and how hard it might be to do it, before you start doing it.</p><p>The process of estimation is high value. Estimating work means dedicating time to understand it, agreeing on that understanding and then communicating that understanding in a standardized way.</p><p>That act of discussing, and then estimating can tease out unexpected or overlooked complexity, miss-understandings and gaps in understanding. If 3 devs agree, but one other has a very different estimate, that is something to be discussed.</p><p>Small? I&apos;ve found that once a single task gets over a few days, all bets are off, so we should break it down and/or get more context. For me, an upper bound on tickets should be a few days.</p><p>What metric you use is much less important than the act of discussing and agreeing. And, once you have that agreement, that metric can be communicated to others, who can take it into consideration when deciding on the importance of any give task or group of tasks to achieve an outcome.</p><h2 id="be-precise">BE PRECISE?</h2><p>Precise estimates and other logical fallacies.</p><p>Another key criticism of estimates is they are not accurate, and so they are not worth the time. As I discussed above, I don&apos;t think this is true. The value is in the process, as much as the output. Refining the accuracy of the estimates is useful in as much as it helps the team communicate and coordinate and better manage their own time/and input, not output.</p><p>They get even less precise if they are used as a measure of output, as they are easy to game, pad or otherwise manipulate.</p><h2 id="why-not-velocity">WHY NOT VELOCITY?</h2><p>In many #NoEstimate posts, they point to looking at velocity (tasks/stories completed) as an alternative to estimating.</p><p>Velocity is not without its drawbacks, it can be manipulated and may incentivize the wrong behaviour depending on how the metric is used.</p><p>But, even if you skip estimation and use velocity, you are still actually estimating on the front, to slice up the work into &quot;small&quot; story units to work on. But you lose resolution, A 1 line type-o fix in a field label vs adding a new database abstraction layer - both could be a single story, but with very different estimates and are not equal.</p><p>It feels like trying to measure an input, with an outcome. And you are going to miss out on the other benefits of estimation, if you skip the process. But perhaps its fine - I&apos;m not sure.</p><h2 id="do-you-trust-me">DO YOU TRUST ME?</h2><p>The final key criticism of estimates I want to consider, is fear. Fear that the estimate they create, will be used as a tool to punish or pressure them to do things that are unsustainable, unreasonable or unachievable and which then cause undue stress and disappointment.</p><p>Yes. This can (and does) happen. It shouldn&apos;t, but it does. Will abandoning estimations fix this? I don&apos;t think so. It might move the conversation from quantitative, to qualitative - which may buy time or give the louder voices a chance to control the narrative a bit. But, if the manager/business/client etc already doesn&apos;t trust a team, a number (or lack of one) isn&apos;t going to change that.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Code Metrics]]></title><description><![CDATA[Q: "How can we measure a software development teams performance?"
