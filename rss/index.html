I fed it a few <strong>typical JavaScript interview questions</strong> and was impressed by the results:</p><blockquote>Create a React component which lets you up and down vote, with buttons, and keeps a running total of the number of up and down votes.</blockquote><pre><code class="language-JavaScript">class UpDownVotes extends React.Component {

        &lt;p&gt;Downvotes: {this.state.downvotes}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    )
  }
}</code></pre><p>Not bad! <strong>Let&apos;s try something a little harder:</strong></p><blockquote>Create a javascript function SimplePassword(str) take the str parameter being passed and determine if it passes as a valid password that follows the list of constraints:<br>1. It must have a capital letter.<br>2. It must contain at least one number.<br>3. It must contain a punctuation mark or mathematical symbol.<br>4. It cannot have the word &quot;password&quot; in the string.<br>5. It must be longer than 7 characters and shorter than 31 characters.<br>If all the above constraints are met within the string, the your program should return the string true, otherwise your program should return the string false. For example: if str is &quot;apple!M7&quot; then your program should return &quot;true&quot;.</blockquote><pre><code class="language-JavaScript">function SimplePassword(str) { 
  if(str.length&gt;7 &amp;&amp; str.length&lt;31){

      var pass = str.split(&quot;&quot;);
      var hasNum = false;
      var hasLetter = false;
      var hasPunc = false;
      for(var i=0;i&lt;pass.length;i++){

        else
          return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;        
}</code></pre><p>Yep, ok. <strong>What about a theory question?</strong></p><blockquote>What do you understand by Closures in JavaScript?</blockquote><pre><code class="language-MarkDown">A closure is a function that makes use of variables defined 
in outer functions that have previously returned. 
In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function 
is created that uses variables from outside its scope.</code></pre><p>Or a question about <strong>what NPM modules to use</strong>?</p><blockquote>Which npm modules would you use to manage a database schema?</blockquote><pre><code class="language-Markdown">There are many npm modules that can be used to manage 
a database schema, but two of the most popular are 
sequelize and knex.</code></pre><p>Ok, let&apos;s dig into that:</p><blockquote>What are the pros and cons of sequelize vs knex?</blockquote><pre><code class="language-Markdown">There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends
on personal preferences and opinions. Some people may prefer
sequelize because it offers more features and is better suited
for larger projects, while others may prefer knex because it
is simpler and easier to use.</code></pre><p><strong>It&apos;s not just code,</strong> it can answer questions about git</p><blockquote>What does the following command do?<br>git diff-tree &#x2013;r {commit hash}</blockquote><pre><code class="language-Markdown">The command git diff-tree &#x2013;r {commit hash} displays the
differences between the commit with the given hash and
its parents.</code></pre><p>or <strong>deployment strategies</strong></p><blockquote>What deployment strategies do you know and have used before? How can a company deploy with no downtime?</blockquote><pre><code class="language-Markdown">There are a few deployment strategies:

1. Blue/Green Deployment: With this strategy, you have two identical
production environments. You deploy your updates to the environment 
that is not currently serving traffic (the &quot;green&quot; environment), and 
then once the updates are deployed and tested, you switch traffic over
to the green environment. This ensures that there is no downtime, as 
users will always be able to access the site/application.

2. Canary Deployment: This is similar to blue/green deployment, but 
instead of having two identical production environments, you have a 
production environment and a staging environment. You deploy your 
updates to the staging environment first, and then if everything looks 
good, you deploy the updates to production. This ensures that there is 
less risk, as you can test the updates in a non-production environment 
first.

3. A/B Testing: With this strategy, you deploy your updates to a small 
subset of users first, and then if everything looks good, you deploy the 
updates to all users. This helps to reduce the risk of deploying to all 
users at once, as you can test the updates with a smaller group first.

4. Rolling Deployment: This strategy involves slowly rolling out the 
updates to all users, rather than deploying all at once. This can help 
to reduce the risk of deploying to all users at once, as you can make 
sure that the updates are working as expected before deploying to all 
users.</code></pre><p><strong>It wasn&apos;t perfect</strong>, it missed parts of questions, it got confused when I used longer and more intricate problems - but over all, it would not fare badly against most entry level or even mid level candidates!</p><p>BUT.

Full time remote work can be an acquired taste and isn&apos;t for everyone, or without its <strong>challenges</strong>. But I really enjoy it.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges is <strong>collaboration</strong>, how do you work with people who are not physically right next to you? Fortunately technology has been there to help, from the early days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy#Telegram_services">Telegrapthy</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">bulletin boards</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion">SVN</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">GIT</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)">Slack</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)">Zoom</a> - and everything in between. Technology has been ever improving the way we are able to make and do things <strong>without being in the same room</strong>.</p><p>For me, there have been a few <strong>game changer moments</strong> in remote working collaboration, over the years, these are a few of mine<strong>:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Going from FTP/Shared folders to any kind of Version control</strong>. No more &quot;oh no&quot; moments. Branches and merges made it possible for lots of people to be working on the same code without making a huge mess.</li><li><strong>IRC and later Slack.</strong> Real-time and asynchronous, group chats with &#xA0;searchable history with developers from around the world, coordinating efforts on your project or just hanging out to talk about the latest tech news.</li><li><strong>Skype and then Zoom.</strong> Voice and Video calls with high quality, multi person conference calls. It made working with a geographically diverse team much simpler - everyone and anyone is only a click away from a team meeting or 1to1.</li><li><strong>Screen sharing, and drawing on screen with Google Hangouts or Zoom.</strong> Seeing what people are working on, the code running, the missing semicolon or rouge variable and being able to highlight / point to things. This allowed for pair programming and more often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debugging</a>, in a way just webcams/microphones did not.</li></ul><p>But <strong>concurrent editing has been missing</strong>. Yes, Google doc has it for documents, and you can do ugly/hacky things using private Etherpad, but <strong>true pair programming has always been really clunky</strong>. </p><p><strong>Until now</strong>. I had tried Live Share, or things like it a few years ago, it was painful. Now it&apos;s as simple as <strong>clicking a link, then pasting a URL</strong> to someone - that&apos;s it.

It&apos;s the<strong> first book in the Moist Von Lipwig series</strong> and so much fun.</p><blockquote><strong>&#x201C;It&apos;s not worth doing something unless someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren&apos;t doing it.&#x201D;</strong> <br> &#xA0;&#x2015; &#xA0; &#xA0; Terry Pratchett</blockquote><p>Once you&apos;ve finished the Lipwig thread, <strong>go back and do all the Industrial Revolution</strong>. Then I really like the Witches thread (which is where I&apos;ve started with my daughter) and after that, go to the Watch! <strong>I hope my excitement for your future enjoyment comes across</strong> - I&apos;m deeply envious of your road ahead.</p><blockquote><strong>&#x201C;Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.&#x201D;</strong> <br> &#xA0;&#x2015; &#xA0; &#xA0; Terry Pratchett, &#xA0;A Hat Full of Sky</blockquote><p>OK, back to Going Postal.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><a href="https://amzn.to/30b7wB6"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ArYd7BgEL.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Pratchett Gateway Book" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption>&quot;Moist von Lipwig was a con artist, a fraud and a man faced with a life choice: be hanged, or put Ankh-Morpork&apos;s ailing postal service back on its feet.&quot;</figcaption></figure><p>It&#x2019;s a story of a con-man, trying to rebuild the postal service in the biggest city on the disc. But it&#x2019;s so much more, <strong>redemption, injustice, stamp collecting, open source, politics, love</strong> and so so so much cutting and <strong>hilarious</strong> observation. You will find yourself laughing out loud.</p><p><strong>Go read it. </strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3H8rRYv">(amazon link here)</a></em></p><blockquote><strong>&#x201C;Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it.

PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH&apos;, the paint wouldn&apos;t even have time to dry.&#x201D;</strong> <br> &#xA0;&#x2015; &#xA0; &#xA0; Terry Pratchett, Thief of Time</blockquote><p>Actually, I want you to enjoy this book so much, <strong>I want to buy you a copy</strong>. The first 5 people to ask, I will buy and send them a copy, under the agreement:</p><ol><li>You read it</li><li>You let me know what you thought</li><li>(If you liked it) You pass the book on to at least 2 more people.</li></ol><blockquote><strong>&#x201C;Stories of imagination tend to upset those without one.&#x201D;</strong> <br> &#xA0;&#x2015; &#xA0; &#xA0; Terry Pratchett</blockquote><p><strong>Deal?</strong></p><blockquote><strong>&#x201C;If you kept changing the way people saw the world, you ended up changing the way you saw yourself.&#x201D;</strong> <br> &#xA0;&#x2015; &#xA0; &#xA0; Terry Pratchett, &#xA0;Going Postal</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best router you've never heard of]]></title><description><![CDATA[GL.iNet?

It is a fascinating topic with some true experts in the field <em>(and me)</em> on the panel:</p><ul><li>Moderator - <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timjamesbond/">Tim Bond</a>, </strong>Director of Insight, <a href="https://dma.org.uk/">Data Marketing Association (DMA)</a></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johntrembley/">John Trembley</a>, </strong>Vice President of Marketing at <a href="https://evolv.ai/">Evolv AI</a></li><li>(me) Alex McFadyen, Head of Technology, <a href="https://ben.productplacement.coma">BEN Group</a></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilberthill/">Gilbert Hill</a>,</strong> Privacy Technologist, Entrepreneur and CEO of <a href="https://www.finflo.io/">FinFlo</a> / <a href="https://tapmydata.com/">TapMyData</a></li></ul><p>Unfortunately, the panel wasn&apos;t recorded, but I still wanted to share the debate and a few notes, as others may find it useful or thought provoking.</p><h2 id="the-core-questions-raised-in-the-debate">The core questions raised in the debate</h2><blockquote><em>When it comes to personalisation, there is often a trade off with concerns of user privacy. Consumers are more likely to pass on their personal information if they are getting truly valuable returns. Can AI help resolve the personalisation and privacy paradox? What are the right approaches?</em></blockquote><p>The conversation flowed between two main areas, privacy and how AI/Tech can help - both interlinked, and expertly navigated by Tim.</p><p>After a quick intro, &#xA0;where we discussed examples in our own lives of personalisation gone well (or badly) we dove into<strong> the question of privacy</strong>:</p><ul><li>Do consumers really care about privacy?</li><li>Is personalisation possible without raising concerns over data privacy? </li><li>How can brands explain the benefits of data sharing? (For both them and the customer)</li></ul><p>Then we moved onto how <strong>can technology help</strong>:</p><ul><li>Can AI help resolve this seeming conflict between personalisation and privacy?</li><li>Is there a risk that consumers are even more concerned by the &#x2018;black boxes&#x2019;? (Processing they can&#x2019;t even see)</li><li>What are the right approaches to bring AI into a business to help? Are there any examples you can share/are aware of?</li></ul><p>We finished on some advice, answering the question:<em> What should the organisations watching today go away and do?</em></p><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><p>Instead of trying to replicate the debate, I&apos;m going to include some ideas shared (likely poorly paraphrased/misremembered - sorry). I hope, however, they are useful or at least thought provoking:</p><ul><li>John Wanamaker (1838-1922) a pioneer in marketing said - <em>&#x201C;Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don&apos;t know which half.&#x201D;</em></li><li><strong>Personalisation, can be a double edged sword </strong>- &quot;personal service&quot; or a &quot;personal recommendation&quot; can be a big positive for the consumer, but if you &quot;get personal&quot;, <strong>it can become creepy</strong> (&quot;is my phone listening to me?&quot;, &quot;how do they know this?&quot;). Especially when the ad/suggestion is outside the expected context or far too specific.</li><li>If users are given control over their data, they will be more deliberate with it - making sure it&apos;s accurate. <strong>Deal them into the process.</strong></li><li>When done well, with the consumer&apos;s needs and privacy in mind, personalisation results in<strong> better outcomes for everyone</strong>; less wasted time/attention of consumers and less wasted dollars from the brand and money to make even better content for the creators. AI can help with all three, <strong>as we saw at BEN with Philo.</strong></li><li>Low conversion rates make already expensive customer views even more expensive - <strong>optimizing for conversion often results in a better ROI</strong> than trying to maximize for views at the top of the funnel.</li><li><strong>Black boxes of decision-making already existed before technology/AI</strong>. Human based processes can often be harder to audit and check - the increased attention to the output data is allowing better systems to be built in the future.</li><li><strong>Governments and industry have roles to play</strong>, and we&apos;ve seen great steps &#xA0;forward with things like <strong>GDPR and CCPA</strong>, but we need to be thinking past what it&apos;s possible to do technologically, or even legally and to what&apos;s <strong>the right thing to do, ethically</strong>. </li><li><strong>PET (Privacy Enhancing Technology) </strong>can help a lot, by offering systems to help improve the privacy of the data though AI or cryptographic means. <strong>Differential privacy is very interesting</strong>.</li></ul><p>My closing comment to the question : <em> What should the organisations watching today go away and do?</em></p><blockquote><em>Brands should start by aiming to <strong>empower and engage with your audience</strong>, by understanding them <strong>as a group and in context</strong> - be respectful. You don&apos;t need to stalk individuals and invade privacy to get results.</em></blockquote><h2 id="further-reading-watching">Further reading / watching</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://ben.productplacement.com/case-study/philo-influencer-campaign/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">BEN&#x2019;s custom, collaborative AI improves Philo&#x2019;s CTR by 172% and conversion efficiency by 10x. - BEN</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Over the course of the campaign our proprietary neural networks improved Philo&#x2019;s CTRs by 172%.

Heavy. I know. But <strong>hard things are worth doing</strong>, and uncomfortable conversations about mental health and even suicide need to happen. <strong>We have to make the conversations about mental health and suicide safe to have</strong>, so if someone needs it, they can feel they are able to have it - the alternative is <em>never</em> having the chance to have the conversation.</p><p>The presentation by Didi Hirch was given with care, compassion, and it was surprisingly uplifting. <strong>I whole heartedly encourage people to explore getting training in suicide prevention</strong>, and/or to encourage awareness and discussion in your peer and professional groups. <strong>It&apos;s important.</strong> Didi Hirch <a href="https://didihirsch.org/training/suicide-prevention-training/">offer sessions</a>, &#xA0;but I suspect there will be similar organizations locally to you - check them out.</p><p><strong>It was an extremely thought provoking presentation</strong>.

Lots of people <strong>hate the wasted time spent</strong> on this daily grind, but some <strong>cherished elements of it</strong> - it&apos;s me time, listening to pod casts, reading, etc.</p><p>This <strong>separation of work and home</strong>, of mental states is something which, I think, deserves more attention and something we&apos;ve lost when we lost our physical commute. For me at least, being able to <strong>compartmentalize those worlds</strong> has been a critical part of maintaining a health work/life balance and perspective.</p><h2 id="how-can-you-mentally-commute">How can you mentally commute?</h2><p>Or to say it another way, <em>how do you move headspace without moving physical space</em>?</p><p>I think it&apos;s actually really simple, for me, it&apos;s and comes down to 2 things.</p><ol><li><strong>Time</strong></li><li><strong>Context</strong></li></ol><p>Both are about enabling a <strong>smooth and predictable transition</strong>, to let your brain, emotions and thoughts move from one state to another.</p><h3 id="time">Time</h3><p>Most people (myself included), <strong>need time to adjust</strong>. There are some among us who have a superpower, they are able to compartmentalize and switch extremely quickly - for everyone else, there is time.</p><p>How much time you need to settle after a day can depend on you and your day, but not spending time on this transition, risks the stresses or excitement from <strong>one area bleeding into the next</strong>. Turning the transition into a habit can also help reduce the time needed, in my experience.</p><h3 id="context">Context</h3><p>You work at work, and are at home at home. But <strong>when you work at home, things get tricky</strong>. So to help with separation, build context.</p><p>I&apos;m lucky, in that I have a room I use as my home office, this means I can leave that room and &quot;<strong>leave work&quot; in that room</strong> too. But even without a room, you can tie your work context to something, a device (a work laptop), a position/chair dedicated to work or even the clothes you are wearing. <strong>Moving out of that context is a signal</strong> to you, your brain, those around you that you&apos;re not working any more.</p><p>Give yourself something to latch onto, as <strong>&quot;work mode&quot; </strong>and so an ability to deliberately switch out of it. <strong>Without it, you are always potentially &quot;at work&quot;</strong>.</p><h2 id="my-routine">My routine</h2><p>I use both time and context to keep my work and home life separated.<strong> I plan my day and schedule around these transitions</strong> has had a HUGE impact on my ability to focus at work and unwind after.</p><p>In my morning, I will take my kids to school, walking. When I get back to the house after dropping them, <strong>I enter my &quot;office&quot; and my day begins</strong> (with the bonus of a little exercise too).</p><p>At the end of my day, I schedule a <strong>15 minute &quot;decompression&quot; time</strong>, it&apos;s in my calendar, as a meeting - I don&apos;t leave work (my room) till it&apos;s done. I use this time to <strong>take stock of the day, look at tomorrow and meditate</strong>. Its worth every second.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.calm.com/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Experience Calm</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Relax with Calm, a simple mindfulness meditation app that brings clarity and peace of mind into your life</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://www.calm.com/_n/favicon.ico" alt="Mental Commuting"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">The #1 App for Meditation and Sleep</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/calm-com/image/upload/v1584113232/www-next/social/calm-meta.png" alt="Mental Commuting"></div></a></figure><p>To help me meditate I use the Calm app. I am fortune that <strong>my employer</strong> (<a href="ben.productplacement.com/">BEN Group</a>) who<strong> takes mental health seriously</strong> and offer a free calm subscription to all employees!
