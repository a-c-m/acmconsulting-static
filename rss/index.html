Builders, not so much.<br><br>Notably, neither group makes for better programmers than the other &#x2014; though they may take wildly different approaches to implementing solutions &#x2014; and <strong>a strong team consists of both.</strong><br><br>I&#x2019;m definitely in the latter category. I find LeetCode &#x2014; and puzzles in general &#x2014; insufferably dull and pointless. But I appreciate that others love LeetCode and puzzles.<br><br>Different strokes for different folks.</blockquote><p>The original author was Dave Voorhis - <a href="https://www.armchair.mb.ca/~dave/">https://www.armchair.mb.ca/~dave/</a></p><h3 id="my-thoughts">My thoughts</h3><p>It&apos;s not the only way to define or group programmers, obviously, but <strong>it&apos;s an interesting lens, </strong>when thinking about <strong>team dynamics, promotions and hiring</strong>.</p><p>Some questions that come to mind:</p><ul><li>If you put a LeetCode gate on the front of your hiring, you could be filtering out or even discouraging highly talented and valuable devs. Do you want to do that?</li><li>Does your personal alignment impact your ability to assess/judge the skills of the other kind of developer?

Full time remote work can be an acquired taste and isn&apos;t for everyone, or without its <strong>challenges</strong>. But I really enjoy it.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges is <strong>collaboration</strong>, how do you work with people who are not physically right next to you? Fortunately technology has been there to help, from the early days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy#Telegram_services">Telegrapthy</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">bulletin boards</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion">SVN</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">GIT</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)">Slack</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)">Zoom</a> - and everything in between. Technology has been ever improving the way we are able to make and do things <strong>without being in the same room</strong>.</p><p>For me, there have been a few <strong>game changer moments</strong> in remote working collaboration, over the years, these are a few of mine<strong>:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Going from FTP/Shared folders to any kind of Version control</strong>. No more &quot;oh no&quot; moments. Branches and merges made it possible for lots of people to be working on the same code without making a huge mess.</li><li><strong>IRC and later Slack.</strong> Real-time and asynchronous, group chats with &#xA0;searchable history with developers from around the world, coordinating efforts on your project or just hanging out to talk about the latest tech news.</li><li><strong>Skype and then Zoom.</strong> Voice and Video calls with high quality, multi person conference calls. It made working with a geographically diverse team much simpler - everyone and anyone is only a click away from a team meeting or 1to1.</li><li><strong>Screen sharing, and drawing on screen with Google Hangouts or Zoom.</strong> Seeing what people are working on, the code running, the missing semicolon or rouge variable and being able to highlight / point to things. This allowed for pair programming and more often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debugging</a>, in a way just webcams/microphones did not.</li></ul><p>But <strong>concurrent editing has been missing</strong>. Yes, Google doc has it for documents, and you can do ugly/hacky things using private Etherpad, but <strong>true pair programming has always been really clunky</strong>. </p><p><strong>Until now</strong>. I had tried Live Share, or things like it a few years ago, it was painful. Now it&apos;s as simple as <strong>clicking a link, then pasting a URL</strong> to someone - that&apos;s it. Could this be the next game changer moment? </p><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack"><strong>Go try it!</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>Or see it in action below:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9QXwSg9-2qQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thinking about thinking (again)]]></title><description><![CDATA[What are your goto mental models about mental models? ]]></description><link>https://www.acmconsulting.eu/post/thinking-about-thinking-again/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6218b4b0a2e9da20b59fd69f</guid><category><![CDATA[Interesting]]></category><category><![CDATA[Managment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software Development]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex McFadyen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 11:07:42 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522435229388-6f7a422cd95b?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDh8fHRoaW5raW5nfGVufDB8fHx8MTY0NTc4NzA3Mg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522435229388-6f7a422cd95b?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDh8fHRoaW5raW5nfGVufDB8fHx8MTY0NTc4NzA3Mg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Thinking about thinking (again)"><p>Whenever I need to think about <strong>how to structure a team, project or new product</strong>, I find myself returning to <strong>the brilliant <a href="https://amzn.to/3BQF85U">Team Topologies book</a></strong>, which I have discussed on this blog before.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.acmconsulting.eu/tumblr/insightful-videosbooks/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Insightful videos/books</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">What books or videos have you watched which were aha moments or step changes in your thinking?

The quotes littered though this post will give you an idea of what to expect when you read his books.</p><blockquote><strong>&#x201C;Steal five dollars and you&apos;re a common thief.

It is a fascinating topic with some true experts in the field <em>(and me)</em> on the panel:</p><ul><li>Moderator - <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timjamesbond/">Tim Bond</a>, </strong>Director of Insight, <a href="https://dma.org.uk/">Data Marketing Association (DMA)</a></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johntrembley/">John Trembley</a>, </strong>Vice President of Marketing at <a href="https://evolv.ai/">Evolv AI</a></li><li>(me) Alex McFadyen, Head of Technology, <a href="https://ben.productplacement.coma">BEN Group</a></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilberthill/">Gilbert Hill</a>,</strong> Privacy Technologist, Entrepreneur and CEO of <a href="https://www.finflo.io/">FinFlo</a> / <a href="https://tapmydata.com/">TapMyData</a></li></ul><p>Unfortunately, the panel wasn&apos;t recorded, but I still wanted to share the debate and a few notes, as others may find it useful or thought provoking.</p><h2 id="the-core-questions-raised-in-the-debate">The core questions raised in the debate</h2><blockquote><em>When it comes to personalisation, there is often a trade off with concerns of user privacy. Consumers are more likely to pass on their personal information if they are getting truly valuable returns. Can AI help resolve the personalisation and privacy paradox? What are the right approaches?</em></blockquote><p>The conversation flowed between two main areas, privacy and how AI/Tech can help - both interlinked, and expertly navigated by Tim.</p><p>After a quick intro, &#xA0;where we discussed examples in our own lives of personalisation gone well (or badly) we dove into<strong> the question of privacy</strong>:</p><ul><li>Do consumers really care about privacy?</li><li>Is personalisation possible without raising concerns over data privacy? </li><li>How can brands explain the benefits of data sharing? (For both them and the customer)</li></ul><p>Then we moved onto how <strong>can technology help</strong>:</p><ul><li>Can AI help resolve this seeming conflict between personalisation and privacy?</li><li>Is there a risk that consumers are even more concerned by the &#x2018;black boxes&#x2019;? (Processing they can&#x2019;t even see)</li><li>What are the right approaches to bring AI into a business to help? Are there any examples you can share/are aware of?</li></ul><p>We finished on some advice, answering the question:<em> What should the organisations watching today go away and do?</em></p><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><p>Instead of trying to replicate the debate, I&apos;m going to include some ideas shared (likely poorly paraphrased/misremembered - sorry). I hope, however, they are useful or at least thought provoking:</p><ul><li>John Wanamaker (1838-1922) a pioneer in marketing said - <em>&#x201C;Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don&apos;t know which half.&#x201D;</em></li><li><strong>Personalisation, can be a double edged sword </strong>- &quot;personal service&quot; or a &quot;personal recommendation&quot; can be a big positive for the consumer, but if you &quot;get personal&quot;, <strong>it can become creepy</strong> (&quot;is my phone listening to me?&quot;, &quot;how do they know this?&quot;). Especially when the ad/suggestion is outside the expected context or far too specific.</li><li>If users are given control over their data, they will be more deliberate with it - making sure it&apos;s accurate. <strong>Deal them into the process.</strong></li><li>When done well, with the consumer&apos;s needs and privacy in mind, personalisation results in<strong> better outcomes for everyone</strong>; less wasted time/attention of consumers and less wasted dollars from the brand and money to make even better content for the creators. AI can help with all three, <strong>as we saw at BEN with Philo.</strong></li><li>Low conversion rates make already expensive customer views even more expensive - <strong>optimizing for conversion often results in a better ROI</strong> than trying to maximize for views at the top of the funnel.</li><li><strong>Black boxes of decision-making already existed before technology/AI</strong>. Human based processes can often be harder to audit and check - the increased attention to the output data is allowing better systems to be built in the future.</li><li><strong>Governments and industry have roles to play</strong>, and we&apos;ve seen great steps &#xA0;forward with things like <strong>GDPR and CCPA</strong>, but we need to be thinking past what it&apos;s possible to do technologically, or even legally and to what&apos;s <strong>the right thing to do, ethically</strong>. </li><li><strong>PET (Privacy Enhancing Technology) </strong>can help a lot, by offering systems to help improve the privacy of the data though AI or cryptographic means. <strong>Differential privacy is very interesting</strong>.</li></ul><p>My closing comment to the question : <em> What should the organisations watching today go away and do?</em></p><blockquote><em>Brands should start by aiming to <strong>empower and engage with your audience</strong>, by understanding them <strong>as a group and in context</strong> - be respectful. You don&apos;t need to stalk individuals and invade privacy to get results.</em></blockquote><h2 id="further-reading-watching">Further reading / watching</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://ben.productplacement.com/case-study/philo-influencer-campaign/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">BEN&#x2019;s custom, collaborative AI improves Philo&#x2019;s CTR by 172% and conversion efficiency by 10x. - BEN</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Over the course of the campaign our proprietary neural networks improved Philo&#x2019;s CTRs by 172%.

Heavy. I know. But <strong>hard things are worth doing</strong>, and uncomfortable conversations about mental health and even suicide need to happen. <strong>We have to make the conversations about mental health and suicide safe to have</strong>, so if someone needs it, they can feel they are able to have it - the alternative is <em>never</em> having the chance to have the conversation.</p><p>The presentation by Didi Hirch was given with care, compassion, and it was surprisingly uplifting. <strong>I whole heartedly encourage people to explore getting training in suicide prevention</strong>, and/or to encourage awareness and discussion in your peer and professional groups. <strong>It&apos;s important.</strong> Didi Hirch <a href="https://didihirsch.org/training/suicide-prevention-training/">offer sessions</a>, &#xA0;but I suspect there will be similar organizations locally to you - check them out.</p><p><strong>It was an extremely thought provoking presentation</strong>.

Lots of people <strong>hate the wasted time spent</strong> on this daily grind, but some <strong>cherished elements of it</strong> - it&apos;s me time, listening to pod casts, reading, etc.</p><p>This <strong>separation of work and home</strong>, of mental states is something which, I think, deserves more attention and something we&apos;ve lost when we lost our physical commute. For me at least, being able to <strong>compartmentalize those worlds</strong> has been a critical part of maintaining a health work/life balance and perspective.</p><h2 id="how-can-you-mentally-commute">How can you mentally commute?</h2><p>Or to say it another way, <em>how do you move headspace without moving physical space</em>?</p><p>I think it&apos;s actually really simple, for me, it&apos;s and comes down to 2 things.</p><ol><li><strong>Time</strong></li><li><strong>Context</strong></li></ol><p>Both are about enabling a <strong>smooth and predictable transition</strong>, to let your brain, emotions and thoughts move from one state to another.</p><h3 id="time">Time</h3><p>Most people (myself included), <strong>need time to adjust</strong>. There are some among us who have a superpower, they are able to compartmentalize and switch extremely quickly - for everyone else, there is time.</p><p>How much time you need to settle after a day can depend on you and your day, but not spending time on this transition, risks the stresses or excitement from <strong>one area bleeding into the next</strong>. Turning the transition into a habit can also help reduce the time needed, in my experience.</p><h3 id="context">Context</h3><p>You work at work, and are at home at home. But <strong>when you work at home, things get tricky</strong>. So to help with separation, build context.</p><p>I&apos;m lucky, in that I have a room I use as my home office, this means I can leave that room and &quot;<strong>leave work&quot; in that room</strong> too. But even without a room, you can tie your work context to something, a device (a work laptop), a position/chair dedicated to work or even the clothes you are wearing. <strong>Moving out of that context is a signal</strong> to you, your brain, those around you that you&apos;re not working any more.</p><p>Give yourself something to latch onto, as <strong>&quot;work mode&quot; </strong>and so an ability to deliberately switch out of it. <strong>Without it, you are always potentially &quot;at work&quot;</strong>.</p><h2 id="my-routine">My routine</h2><p>I use both time and context to keep my work and home life separated.<strong> I plan my day and schedule around these transitions</strong> has had a HUGE impact on my ability to focus at work and unwind after.</p><p>In my morning, I will take my kids to school, walking. When I get back to the house after dropping them, <strong>I enter my &quot;office&quot; and my day begins</strong> (with the bonus of a little exercise too).</p><p>At the end of my day, I schedule a <strong>15 minute &quot;decompression&quot; time</strong>, it&apos;s in my calendar, as a meeting - I don&apos;t leave work (my room) till it&apos;s done. I use this time to <strong>take stock of the day, look at tomorrow and meditate</strong>. Its worth every second.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.calm.com/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Experience Calm</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Relax with Calm, a simple mindfulness meditation app that brings clarity and peace of mind into your life</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://www.calm.com/_n/favicon.ico" alt="Mental Commuting"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">The #1 App for Meditation and Sleep</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/calm-com/image/upload/v1584113232/www-next/social/calm-meta.png" alt="Mental Commuting"></div></a></figure><p>To help me meditate I use the Calm app. I am fortune that <strong>my employer</strong> (<a href="ben.productplacement.com/">BEN Group</a>) who<strong> takes mental health seriously</strong> and offer a free calm subscription to all employees!

Remind my teams to do the same - yes. But what about others who are not in my teams, or what about situations where you <strong>just need a pause, a moment to collect yourself</strong>?</p><p>One area of stress, especially in a COVID world has been meetings, endless back to back calls. <strong>In a physical world, you have time between meetings</strong> even if it&apos;s just walking from meeting room A to B - you get time to switch context, grab a drink etc. With all meetings happening from your desk, that&apos;s no longer there. <strong>Back to back calls can mean not even getting up from the desk for hours</strong>.</p><p>Enter <em>#firstfiveminutes </em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><a href="https://www.firstfiveminutes.club/"><img src="https://www.firstfiveminutes.club/assets/images/sharescreen.png" class="kg-image" alt="Microdosing wellness?" loading="lazy"></a></figure><blockquote>The idea is simple.

Also, if there is a 10-minute gap in your calendar, someone could just schedule another meeting into that slot!</p><p>You could also try to <strong>end your meeting early</strong> - but, lets be realistic that is much harder than it seems, especially if the conversation is flowing. Fewer meetings, meeting free days/afternoons etc are all great options too - but sometimes or for some teams/people, that&apos;s just not an option.</p><p><strong>I have decided to take matters into my own hands</strong>, to give people a microdose of calm, a moment to get water, stretch or take a bathroom break - seems silly, but the response so far has been <strong>extremely positive</strong>. I wonder if it&apos;s like <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier">giving thanks to make you happier</a>, if giving wellness/mental health can make you healthier?</p><p><strong>Can&apos;t hurt to try - right?</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hate cookie banners?

By using the same questions/metrics/structure everyone knows what to expect which lets them focus on the change, not the structure.</p><p>An example of this is the 5:15 report (<a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/management/cut-down-on-reports-with-the-5-15-method/article4106997/">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/management/cut-down-on-reports-with-the-5-15-method/article4106997/</a>). The idea of this report is to create a status update which takes no more than 15 minutes to write, and no more than 5 minutes to read/understand. Repeatable format, easy to use.</p><p>I use 5:15 reports with my directs and manager as a way to get on the same page before a 1:1, so we can spend more time talking about things that need to be discussed.</p><p>I customized the 5:15 template, to work for me/my team. This the 1:1 template i use:</p><p><strong>1. What personal accomplishments were made in the last week?</strong><br><strong>2. What are your personal priorities for the next week?</strong><br><strong>3. What blockers do you have, were overcome, do you see coming?</strong><br><strong>4. What would you like advice/guidance/help/more time to think about?</strong><br><strong>5. How are you feeling about work in general? Where is your head at?</strong><br><strong>6. What interesting/funny/clever thing caught your eye recently (can be non-work related)?</strong></p><p>I really like the last 2 questions, as they can give a great jumping off point for the 1:1 and insight into how things are going.</p><p>I&apos;ve also tried to use this format for group/team updates, but with less success. </p><p>Very interested to learn about other patterns or templates, especially for group / department or company wide levels. Please drop me a note on the usual channels if you have found things that work.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
